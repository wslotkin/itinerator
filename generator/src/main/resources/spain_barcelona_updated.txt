spain	barcelona	La Catedral	Barcelona’s central place of worship presents a magnificent image. The richly decorated main facade, laced with gargoyles and the stone intricacies you would expect of northern European Gothic, sets it quite apart from other churches in Barcelona. The facade was actually added in 1870, although the rest of the building was built between 1298 and 1460. The other facades are sparse in decoration, and the octagonal, flat-roofed towers are a clear reminder that, even here, Catalan Gothic architectural principles prevailed.The interior is a broad, soaring space divided into a central nave and two aisles by lines of elegant, slim pillars. The cathedral was one of the few churches in Barcelona spared by the anarchists in the civil war, so its ornamentation, never overly lavish, is intact. The faithful frequently notice the absence of holy water in the church’s fonts. This is not because of a scarcity of holy water, but a preventive measure taken in the face of fear over the 2009–10 swine flu (H1N1) epidemic.In the first chapel on the right from the northwest entrance, the main Crucifixion figure above the altar is Sant Crist de Lepant. It is said Don Juan’s flagship bore it into battle at Lepanto and that the figure acquired its odd stance by dodging an incoming cannonball. Further along this same wall, past the southwest transept, are the wooden coffins of Count Ramon Berenguer I and his wife Almodis, founders of the 11th-century Romanesque predecessor to the present cathedral. Left from the main entrance is the baptismal font where, according to one story, six North American Indians brought to Europe by Columbus after his first voyage of accidental discovery were bathed in holy water.In the middle of the central nave is the late-14th-century, exquisitely sculpted timber coro (choir stalls). The coats of arms on the stalls belong to members of the Barcelona chapter of the Order of the Golden Fleece. Emperor Carlos V presided over the order’s meeting here in 1519. Take the time to look at the workmanship up close – the Virgin Mary and Child depicted on the pulpit are especially fine.A broad staircase before the main altar leads you down to the crypt, which contains the tomb of Santa Eulàlia, one of Barcelona’s two patron saints and more affectionately known as Laia. The reliefs on the alabaster sarcophagus, executed by Pisan artisans, recount some of her tortures and, along the top strip, the removal of her body to its present resting place.For a bird’s-eye view (mind the poop) of medieval Barcelona, visit the cathedral’s roof and tower by taking the lift (€3) from the Capella de les Animes del Purgatori near the northeast transept.From the southwest transept, exit by the partly Romanesque door (one of the few remnants of the present church’s predecessor) to the leafy claustre (cloister), with its fountains and flock of 13 geese. The geese supposedly represent the age of Santa Eulàlia at the time of her martyrdom and have, generation after generation, been squawking here since medieval days. They make fine watchdogs! One of the cloister chapels commemorates 930 priests, monks and nuns martyred during the civil war.Along the northern flank of the cloister you can enter the Sala Capitular (Chapter House). Although it’s bathed in rich red carpet and graced with fine timber seating, the few artworks gathered here are of minor interest. Among them figure a pietà by Bartolomeo Bermejo. A couple of doors down in the northwest corner of the cloister is the Capella de Santa Llúcia, one of the few reminders of Romanesque Barcelona (although the interior is largely Gothic). Walk out the door on to Carrer de Santa Llúcia and turn around to look at the exterior – you can see that, although incorporated into La Catedral, it is a separate building.Upon exiting the Capella de Santa Llúcia, wander across the lane into the 16th-century Casa de l’Ardiaca, which houses the city’s archives. You may stroll around the supremely serene courtyard, cooled by trees and a fountain; it was renovated by Lluis Domènech i Montaner in 1902, when the building was owned by the lawyers’ college. Montaner also designed the postal slot, which is adorned with swallows and a tortoise, said to represent the swiftness of truth and the plodding pace of justice. You can get a good glimpse at some stout Roman wall in here. Upstairs, you can look down into the courtyard and across to La Catedral.You may visit La Catedral in one of two ways. In the morning or afternoon, entrance is free and you can opt to visit any combination of the choir stalls, chapter house and roof. To visit all three areas, it costs less (and is less crowded) to enter for the so-called ‘special visit’ between 1pm and 5pm.Across Carrer del Bisbe is the 17th-century Palau Episcopal (Palau del Bisbat; Bishop’s Palace). Virtually nothing remains of the original 13th-century structure. The Roman city’s northwest gate stood here and you can see the lower segments of the Roman towers that stood on either side of the gate at the base of the Palau Episcopal and Casa de l’Ardiaca. In fact, the lower part of the entire northwest wall of the Casa de l’Ardiaca is of Roman origin – you can also make out part of the first arch of a Roman aqueduct.Across Plaça Nova from La Catedral your eye may be caught by childlike scribblings on the facade of the Col·legi de Arquitectes (Architectural College). It is, in fact, a giant contribution by Picasso from 1962. Representing Mediterranean festivals, it was much ridiculed by the local press when it was unveiled.	90	2.176366	41.384183	5.5	1508	982	209	24	15	4.5	['32:00 - 48:30', '56:00 - 72:30', '80:00 - 96:30', '104:00 - 120:30', '128:00 - 144:30', '152:00 - 168:30', '41:15 - 43:30', '65:15 - 67:30', '89:15 - 91:30', '113:15 - 115:30', '137:15 - 139:30', '161:15 - 163:30']	['Churches & Cathedrals', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	Museu Picasso	The setting alone, in five contiguous medieval stone mansions, makes the Museu Picasso unique (and worth the probable queues). The pretty courtyards, galleries and staircases preserved in the first three of these buildings are as delightful as the collection inside.While the collection concentrates on the artist’s formative years – sometimes disappointing for those hoping for a feast of his better-known later works (they had better head for Paris) – there is enough material from subsequent periods to give you a thorough impression of the man’s versatility and genius. Above all, you come away feeling that Picasso was the true original, always one step ahead of himself (let alone anyone else), in his search for new forms of expression.The permanent collection is housed in Palau Aguilar, Palau del Baró de Castellet and Palau Meca, all dating to the 14th century. The 18th-century Casa Mauri, built over medieval remains (even some Roman leftovers have been identified), and the adjacent 14th-century Palau Finestres accommodate temporary exhibitions.The collection, which includes more than 3500 artworks, is strongest on Picasso’s earliest years, up until 1904, which is apt considering that the artist spent his formative creative years in Barcelona. Allegedly, it was Picasso himself who proposed the museum's creation in 1960, to his friend and personal secretary Jaume Sabartés, a Barcelona native. Three years later, the 'Sabartés Collection' was opened, since a museum bearing Picasso’s name would have been met with censorship – Picasso's opposition to the Franco regime was well known. The Museu Picasso we see today opened in 1983. It originally held only Sabartés' personal collection of Picasso's art and a handful of works hanging at the Barcelona Museums of Art, but the collection gradually expanded with donations from Salvador Dalí and Sebastià Junyer Vidal among others, though the largest part of the present collection came from Picasso himself. His widow, Jacqueline Roque, also donated 41 ceramic pieces and the Woman With Bonnet painting after Picasso's death. The original collection still hangs in the Palau Aguilar.A visit starts with sketches and oils from Picasso’s earliest years in Málaga and La Coruña – around 1893–95. Some of his self-portraits and the portraits of his father, which date from 1896, are evidence enough of his precocious talent. Retrato de la Tía Pepa (Portrait of Aunt Pepa), done in Málaga in 1896, shows the incredible maturity of his brushstrokes and his ability to portray character – at the tender age of 15! Picasso painted the enormous Ciència i Caritat (Science and Charity) in the same year, showcasing his masterful academic techniques of portraiture. His ingeniousness extends to his models too, with his father standing in for the doctor, and a beggar whom he hired off the street along with her offspring, modeling the sick woman and the child. This painting made the young artist be noticed in the higher echelons of Spain's art world, when Ciència i Caritat was awarded an Honorary Mention at the General Fine Arts Exhibition in Madrid in 1897.In rooms 5–7 hang paintings from his first Paris sojourn, while room 8 is dedicated to the first significant new stage in his development, the Blue Period. Woman with Bonnet is an important work from this period, depicting a captive from the Saint-Lazare women's prison and veneral disease hospital which Picasso visited when in Paris – this also sets up the theme of Picasso's fascination with those inhabiting the down-and-out layers of society.His nocturnal blue-tinted views of Terrats de Barcelona (Roofs of Barcelona) and El Foll (The Madman) are cold and cheerless, yet somehow alive. Terrats de Barcelona was painted during his second stint at the 17 Carrer de la Riera Sant Joan studio, in 1903 – he painted the city rooftops frequently, from different perspectives in this period. El Foll is significant of the artist's interest in the people on the margins of society, and Picasso made many drawings of beggars, the blind and the impoverished elderly throughout 1903 and 1904.A few cubist paintings pop up in rooms 10 and 11; check the Glass and Tobacco Packet still-life painting, a beautiful and simple work. Picasso started to experiment with still life in 1924 – something he'd done before but had not taken to as seriously as he would from hereon.From 1954 to 1962 Picasso was obsessed with the idea of researching and ‘rediscovering’ the greats, in particular Velázquez. In 1957 he made a series of renditions of the latter’s masterpiece, Las Meninas, now displayed in rooms 12–15. It is as though Picasso has looked at the original Velázquez painting through a prism reflecting all the styles he had worked through until then, creating his own masterpiece in the process. This is a wonderful opportunity to see Las Meninas in its entirety, in this beautiful space.The last rooms contain his dove paintings, engravings and some 40 ceramic pieces completed throughout the latter years of his unceasingly creative life. You'll see plates and bowls decorated with simple, single-line drawings of fish, owls and other animal shapes, typical for Picasso's daubing on clay.	150	2.181237	41.385165	5.0	1182	1105	485	118	42	4.0	['57:00 - 67:00', '81:00 - 91:00', '105:00 - 117:30', '9:00 - 19:00', '129:00 - 139:00', '153:00 - 163:00']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	Mercat de la Boqueria	Mercat de la Boqueria is possibly La Rambla’s most interesting building, not so much for its Modernista-influenced design (it was actually built over a long period, from 1840 to 1914, on the site of the former St Joseph monastery), but for the action of the food market within.One of the greatest sound, smell and colour sensations in Europe is Barcelona’s most central produce market, the Mercat de la Boqueria. It spills over with all the rich and varied bounty of fruit and vegetable stands, seemingly limitless varieties of sea critters, sausages, cheeses, meat (including the finest Jabugo ham) and sweets.According to some chronicles, there has been a market on this spot since 1217, and while today it is a tourist attraction in its own right, it has always been the place where locals come to shop. Many of Barcelona's top restaurateurs buy their produce here, which vouches for the quality of the market's offer. Nowadays it’s no easy task getting past the gawping tourists to indicate the slippery slab of sole you’re after, or the tempting piece of Asturian queso de cabra (goat’s cheese).La Boqueria is dotted with half a dozen or so unassuming places to eat, and eat well, with stallholders opening up at lunchtime. Whether you eat here or if you're self-catering, it's worth trying some of Catalonia's gastronomical specialities, such as bacallà salat (dried salted cod) that usually comes in an esqueixada, a tomato, onion and black olive salad with frisée lettuce; calçots (a cross between a leek and an onion), which are chargrilled and the insides eaten as a messy whole; cargols (snails), a Catalan staple that is best eaten baked as cargols a la llauna; peus de porc (pig's trotters), which are often stewed with snails; or percebes (goose-necked barnacles). Much loved across Spain, these look like witch fingers and are eaten with a garlic and parsley sauce.	90	2.172064	41.381808	5.5	3357	1314	223	53	25	4.5	['32:00 - 44:30', '56:00 - 68:30', '80:00 - 92:30', '104:00 - 116:30', '128:00 - 140:30', '152:00 - 164:30']	['Specialty & Gift Shops', 'Shopping']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	La Sagrada Família	If you have time for only one sightseeing outing, this should be it. La Sagrada Família inspires awe by its sheer verticality, and in the manner of the medieval cathedrals it emulates, it’s still under construction after more than 100 years. When completed, the highest tower will be more than half as high again as those that stand today.Unfinished it may be, but it attracts around 2.8 million visitors a year and is the most visited monument in Spain. The most important recent tourist was Pope Benedict XVI, who consecrated the church in a huge ceremony in November 2010.The Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família (Expiatory Temple of the Holy Family) was Antoni Gaudí’s all-consuming obsession. Given the commission by a conservative society that wished to build a temple as atonement for the city’s sins of modernity, Gaudí saw its completion as his holy mission. As funds dried up, he contributed his own, and in the last years of his life he was never shy of pleading with anyone he thought a likely donor.Gaudí devised a temple 95m long and 60m wide, able to seat 13,000 people, with a central tower 170m high above the transept (representing Christ) and another 17 of 100m or more. The 12 along the three facades represent the Apostles, while the remaining five represent the Virgin Mary and the four Evangelists. With his characteristic dislike for straight lines (there were none in nature, he said), Gaudí gave his towers swelling outlines inspired by the weird peaks of the holy mountain Montserrat outside Barcelona, and encrusted them with a tangle of sculpture that seems an outgrowth of the stone.At Gaudí’s death, only the crypt, the apse walls, one portal and one tower had been finished. Three more towers were added by 1930, completing the northeast (Nativity) facade. In 1936 anarchists burned and smashed the interior, including workshops, plans and models. Work began again in 1952, but controversy has always clouded progress. Opponents of the continuation of the project claim that the computer models based on what little of Gaudí’s plans survived the anarchists’ ire have led to the creation of a monster that has little to do with Gaudí’s plans and style. It is a debate that appears to have little hope of resolution. Like or hate what is being done, the fascination it awakens is undeniable.Guesses on when construction might be complete range from the 2020s to the 2040s. Even before reaching that point, some of the oldest parts of the church, especially the apse, have required restoration work.The Interior & the ApseInside, work on roofing over the church was completed in 2010. The roof is held up by a forest of extraordinary angled pillars. As the pillars soar towards the ceiling, they sprout a web of supporting branches, creating the effect of a forest canopy. The tree image is in no way fortuitous – Gaudí envisaged such an effect. Everything was thought through, including the shape and placement of windows to create the mottled effect one would see with sunlight pouring through the branches of a thick forest. The pillars are of four different types of stone. They vary in colour and load-bearing strength, from the soft Montjuïc stone pillars along the lateral aisles through to granite, dark grey basalt and finally burgundy-tinged Iranian porphyry for the key columns at the intersection of the nave and transept. Tribunes built high above the aisles can host two choirs; the main tribune up to 1300 people and the children’s tribune up to 300.Nativity FacadeThe Nativity Facade is the artistic pinnacle of the building, mostly created under Gaudí’s personal supervision. You can climb high up inside some of the four towers by a combination of lifts and narrow spiral staircases – a vertiginous experience. Do not climb the stairs if you have cardiac or respiratory problems. The towers are destined to hold tubular bells capable of playing complex music at great volume. Their upper parts are decorated with mosaics spelling out ‘Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus, Hosanna in Excelsis, Amen, Alleluia’. Asked why he lavished so much care on the tops of the spires, which no one would see from close up, Gaudí answered: ‘The angels will see them.’Three sections of the portal represent, from left to right, Hope, Charity and Faith. Among the forest of sculpture on the Charity portal you can see, low down, the manger surrounded by an ox, an ass, the shepherds and kings, and angel musicians. Some 30 different species of plant from around Catalonia are reproduced here, and the faces of the many figures are taken from plaster casts done of local people and the occasional one made from corpses in the local morgue!Directly above the blue stained-glass window is the Archangel Gabriel’s Annunciation to Mary. At the top is a green cypress tree, a refuge in a storm for the white doves of peace dotted over it. The mosaic work at the pinnacle of the towers is made from Murano glass, from Venice.To the right of the facade is the curious Claustre del Roser, a Gothic style mini-cloister tacked on to the outside of the church (rather than the classic square enclosure of the great Gothic church monasteries). Once inside, look back to the intricately decorated entrance. On the lower right-hand side, you’ll notice the sculpture of a reptilian devil handing a terrorist a bomb. Barcelona was regularly rocked by political violence and bombings were frequent in the decades prior to the civil war. The sculpture is one of several on the ‘temptations of men and women’.Passion FacadeThe southwest Passion Facade, on the theme of Christ’s last days and death, was built between 1954 and 1978 based on surviving drawings by Gaudí, with four towers and a large, sculpture-bedecked portal. The sculptor, Josep Subirachs, worked on its decoration from 1986 to 2006. He did not attempt to imitate Gaudí, rather producing angular, controversial images of his own. The main series of sculptures, on three levels, are in an S-shaped sequence, starting with the Last Supper at the bottom left and ending with Christ’s burial at the top right. Decorative work on the Passion Facade continues even today, as construction of the Glory Facade moves ahead.To the right, in front of the Passion Facade, the Escoles de Gaudí is one of his simpler gems. Gaudí built this as a children’s school, creating an original, undulating roof of brick that continues to charm architects to this day. Inside is a re-creation of Gaudí’s modest office as it was when he died, and explanations of the geometric patterns and plans at the heart of his building techniques.Glory FacadeThe Glory Facade is under construction and will, like the others, be crowned by four towers – the total of 12 representing the Twelve Apostles. Gaudí wanted it to be the most magnificent facade of the church. Inside will be the narthex, a kind of foyer made up of 16 ‘lanterns’, a series of hyperboloid forms topped by cones. Further decoration will make the whole building a microcosmic symbol of the Christian church, with Christ represented by a massive 170m central tower above the transept, and the five remaining planned towers symbolising the Virgin Mary and the four evangelists.Museu GaudíOpen the same times as the church, the Museu Gaudí, below ground level, includes interesting material on Gaudí's life and other works, as well as models and photos of La Sagrada Família. You can see a good example of his plumb-line models that showed him the stresses and strains he could get away with in construction. A side hall towards the eastern end of the museum leads to a viewing point above the simple crypt in which the genius is buried. The crypt, where Masses are now held, can also be visited from the Carrer de Mallorca side of the church.Exploring La SagradaAlthough essentially a building site, the completed sections and museum may be explored at leisure. Fifty-minute guided tours (€4) are offered. Alternatively, pick up an audio tour (€4), for which you need ID. Enter from Carrer de Sardenya and Carrer de la Marina. Once inside, €2.50 will get you into lifts that rise up inside towers in the Nativity and Passion facades. These two facades, each with four sky-scraping towers, are the sides of the church. The main Glory Facade, on which work is underway, closes off the southeast end on Carrer de Mallorca.	150	2.17433316086	41.4034481823	4.5	39301	8973	2453	542	280	4.5	['9:00 - 20:00', '33:00 - 44:00', '57:00 - 68:00', '81:00 - 92:00', '105:00 - 116:00', '129:00 - 140:00', '153:00 - 164:00']	['Churches & Cathedrals', 'Architectural Buildings', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
spain	barcelona	Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya (MNAC)	From across the city, the bombastic neobaroque silhouette of the Palau Nacional can be seen on the slopes of Montjuïc. Built for the 1929 World Exhibition and restored in 2005, it houses a vast collection of mostly Catalan art spanning the early Middle Ages to the early 20th century. The high point is the collection of extraordinary Romanesque frescoes.This building has come to be one of the city’s prime symbols of the region’s separate, Catalan identity, but the fact that it was constructed under the centralist dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, lends a whiff of irony.The real highlight here is the Romanesque art section, considered the most important concentration of early medieval art in the world. Rescued from neglected country churches across northern Catalonia in the early 20th century, the collection consists of 21 frescoes, woodcarvings and painted altar frontals (low-relief wooden panels that were the forerunners of the elaborate altarpieces that adorned later churches). The insides of several churches have been recreated and the frescoes – in some cases fragmentary, in others extraordinarily complete and alive with colour – have been placed as they were when in situ.The two most striking fresco sets follow one after the other. The first, in Àmbit 5, is a magnificent image of Christ in Majesty done around 1123. Based on the text of the Apocalypse, we see Christ enthroned on a rainbow with the world at his feet. He holds a book open with the words Ego Sum Lux Mundi (I am the Light of the World) and is surrounded by the four Evangelists. The images were taken from the apse of the Església de Sant Climent de Taüll in northwest Catalonia. In Àmbit 7 are frescoes done around the same time in the nearby Església de Santa Maria de Taüll. This time the central image taken from the apse is of the Virgin Mary and Christ Child. These images were not mere decoration but tools of instruction in the basics of Christian faith for the local population – try to set yourself in the mind of the average medieval citizen: illiterate, ignorant, fearful and in most cases eking out a subsistence living. These images transmitted the basic personalities and tenets of the faith and were accepted at face value by most.Even the rudimentary 'scratchings', done most probably by the priests, of animals, crosses and other symbols, have been rescued and preserved here.Opposite the Romanesque collection on the ground floor is the museum’s Gothic art section. In these halls you can see Catalan Gothic painting and works from other Spanish and Mediterranean regions. Look out especially for the work of Bernat Martorell in Àmbit 32 and Jaume Huguet in Àmbit 34. Among Martorell’s works figure images of the martyrdom of St Vincent and St Llúcia. Huguet’s Consagració de Sant Agustí, in which St Augustine is depicted as a bishop, is dazzling in its detail.As the Gothic collection draws to a close, you pass through two separate and equally eclectic private collections. The Cambò Bequest, by Francesc Cambó (1876–1947) spans the history of European painting between the 14th and the beginning of the 19th century, and the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection presents a selection of painting and sculpture of European art produced between the 13th and the 18th centuries on loan to the MNAC by the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza in Madrid. The MNAC added an extra floor to absorb these two collections. Much of the work from the Cambò Bequest was kept in a Pedralbes convent before being transferred here, along with the mainly Modernista holdings from the former Museum of Modern Art. The Thyssen-Bornemisza collection's highlight is Fra Angelico's (1395–1455) Madonna of Humility, whereas the Cambò Bequest holds wonderful works by the Venetian Renaissance masters Veronese (1528–88), Titian (1490–1557) and Canaletto (1697–1768), along with those of Rubens (1577–1640) and even England’s Gainsborough (1727–88), its grand finale being examples of work by Francisco de Goya (1746–28).From here you pass into the great domed central hall. This area is sometimes used for concerts. Up on the next floor, the collection turns to modern art, mainly but not exclusively Catalan. At the time of writing, this collection was being rearranged thematically (Modernisme, Noucentisme, Civil War and so on), but it is worth looking out for Modernista painters Ramon Casas and Santiago Rusiñol, as well as the recently deceased Antoni Tàpies.Also on show are items of Modernista furniture and decoration, which include a mural by Ramon Casas (the artist and Pere Romeu on a tandem bicycle) that once adorned the legendary bar and restaurant Els Quatre Gats.After all this, you can relax in the museum restaurant, which offers great views north towards Plaça d’Espanya. Finally, students can use the Biblioteca del MNAC, the city’s main art reference library.The museum’s displays account for little more than 20% of its holdings. The rest is kept in storerooms that can be visited on a guided tour (€8.40, call ahead to arrange). Since the displays themselves already represent an enormous chunk to absorb in a day, a separate day should be set aside for visiting the reserves.	120	2.15377985393	41.3681780187	5.5	1842	894	205	33	8	4.5	['10:00 - 14:30', '58:00 - 67:00', '82:00 - 91:00', '106:00 - 115:00', '130:00 - 139:00', '154:00 - 163:00']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	Museu d'Història de Barcelona	One of Barcelona's most fascinating museums takes you back through the centuries to the very foundations of Roman Barcino. You'll stroll over ruins of the old streets, sewers, laundries and wine- and fish-making factories that flourished here following the town's founding by Emperor Augustus around 10 BC. Equally impressive is the building itself, which was once part of the Palau Reial Major (Grand Royal Palace) on Plaça del Rei, among the key locations of medieval princely power in Barcelona.The square is frequently the scene of organised or impromptu concerts and is one of the most atmospheric corners of the medieval city.Enter through Casa Padellàs , just south of Plaça del Rei. Casa Padellàs was built for a 16th-century noble family in Carrer dels Mercaders and moved here, stone by stone, in the 1930s. It has a courtyard typical of Barcelona’s late-Gothic and baroque mansions, with a graceful external staircase up to the 1st floor. Today it leads to a restored Roman tower and a section of Roman wall (whose exterior faces Plaça Ramon de Berenguer el Gran), as well as a section of the house set aside for temporary exhibitions.Below ground is a remarkable walk through about 4 sq km of excavated Roman and Visigothic Barcelona. After the display on the typical Roman domus (villa), you reach a public laundry (outside in the street were containers for people to urinate into, as the urine was used as disinfectant). You pass more laundries and dyeing shops, a 6th-century public cold-water bath and more dye shops. As you hit the Cardo Minor (a main street), you turn right then left and reach various shops dedicated to the making of garum. This paste, a fave food across the Roman Empire, was made of mashed-up fish intestines, eggs and blood. Occasionally prawns, cockles and herbs were added to create other flavours. Further on are fish-preserve stores. Fish were sliced up (and all innards removed for making garum) and laid in alternate layers with salt to preserve, sitting in troughs for about three weeks before being ready for sale and export.Next come remnants of a 6th- to 7th-century church and episcopal buildings, followed by winemaking stores, with ducts for allowing the must to flow off and ceramic, round-bottomed dolia for storing and ageing wine. Ramparts then wind around and upward, past remains of the gated patio of a Roman house, the medieval Palau Episcopal (Bishops’ Palace) and into two broad vaulted halls with displays on medieval Barcelona.You eventually emerge at a hall and ticket office set up on the north side of Plaça del Rei. To your right is the Saló del Tinell , the banqueting hall of the royal palace and a fine example of Catalan Gothic (built 1359-70). Its broad arches and bare walls give a sense of solemnity that would have made an appropriate setting for Fernando and Isabel to hear Columbus’ first reports of the New World. The hall is sometimes used for temporary exhibitions, which may cost extra and mean that your peaceful contemplation of its architectural majesty is somewhat obstructed.As you leave the saló you come to the 14th-century Capella Reial de Santa Àgata , the palace chapel. Outside, a spindly bell tower rises from the northeast side of Plaça del Rei. Inside, all is bare except for the 15th-century altarpiece and the magnificent techumbre (decorated timber ceiling). The altarpiece is considered to be one of Jaume Huguet’s finest surviving works.Head down the fan-shaped stairs into Plaça del Rei and look up to observe the Mirador del Rei Martí (lookout tower of King Martin), built in 1555, long after the king’s death.

spain	barcelona	Park Güell	North of Gràcia and about 4km from Plaça de Catalunya, Park Güell is where Gaudí turned his hand to landscape gardening. It’s a strange, enchanting place where his passion for natural forms really took flight – to the point where the artificial almost seems more natural than the natural.Park Güell originated in 1900, when Count Eusebi Güell bought a tree-covered hillside (then outside Barcelona) and hired Gaudí to create a miniature city of houses for the wealthy in landscaped grounds. The project was a commercial flop and was abandoned in 1914 – but not before Gaudí had created 3km of roads and walks, steps, a plaza and two gatehouses in his inimitable manner. In 1922 the city bought the estate for use as a public park.Just inside the main entrance on Carrer d’Olot, immediately recognisable by the two Hansel-and-Gretel gatehouses, is the park’s Centre d’Interpretaciò, in the Pavelló de Consergeria, which is a typically curvaceous former porter’s home that hosts a display on Gaudí’s building methods and the history of the park. There are nice views from the top floor.The steps up from the entrance, guarded by a mosaic dragon/lizard (a copy of which you can buy in many downtown souvenir shops), lead to the Sala Hipóstila (aka the Doric Temple). This is a forest of 88 stone columns, some of which lean like mighty trees bent by the weight of time, originally intended as a market. To the left curves a gallery whose twisted stonework columns and roof give the effect of a cloister beneath tree roots – a motif repeated in several places in the park. On top of the Sala Hipóstila is a broad open space whose centrepiece is the Banc de Trencadís, a tiled bench curving sinuously around its perimeter and designed by one of Gaudí’s closest colleagues, architect Josep Maria Jujol (1879–1949). With Gaudí, however, there is always more than meets the eye. This giant platform was designed as a kind of catchment area for rainwater washing down the hillside. The water is filtered through a layer of stone and sand, and it drains down through the columns to an underground cistern.The spired house over to the right is the Casa-Museu Gaudí, where Gaudí lived for most of his last 20 years (1906–26). It contains furniture by him (including items that were once at home in La Pedrera, Casa Batlló and Casa Calvet) and other memorabilia. The house was built in 1904 by Francesc Berenguer i Mestres as a prototype for the 60 or so houses that were originally planned here.Much of the park is still wooded, but it’s laced with pathways. The best views are from the cross-topped Turó del Calvari in the southwest corner.The walk from metro stop Lesseps is signposted. From the Vallcarca stop, it is marginally shorter and the uphill trek eased by escalators. Bus 24 drops you at an entrance near the top of the park.The park is extremely popular (it gets an estimated 4 million visitors a year, about 86% of them tourists) and in 2013 an entrance fee was imposed on the central area containing most of its attractions. Access is limited to a certain number of people every half-hour, and it's wise to book ahead online.	210	2.153213	41.413509	5.5	13765	7789	2664	578	263	4.5	['8:00 - 20:00', '32:00 - 44:00', '56:00 - 68:00', '80:00 - 92:00', '104:00 - 116:00', '128:00 - 140:00', '152:00 - 164:00']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	Parc de la Ciutadella	Come for a stroll, a picnic, a visit to the zoo or to inspect Catalonia’s regional parliament, but don’t miss a visit to this, the most central green lung in the city. Parc de la Ciutadella is perfect for winding down.After the War of the Spanish Succession, Felipe V razed a swath of La Ribera to build a huge fortress (La Ciutadella), designed to keep watch over Barcelona. It became a loathed symbol of everything Catalans hated about Madrid and the Bourbon kings, and was later used as a political prison. Only in 1869 did the central government allow its demolition, after which the site was turned into a park and used for the Universal Exhibition of 1888.The monumental cascada (waterfall) near the Passeig de Pujades park entrance, created between 1875 and 1881 by Josep Fontserè with the help of an enthusiastic young Gaudí, is a dramatic combination of statuary, rugged rocks, greenery and thundering water – all of it perfectly artificial. Nearby, you can hire a rowing boat to paddle about in the small lake.To the southeast, in what might be seen as an exercise in black humour, the fort’s former arsenal now houses the Parlament de Catalunya . You can join free guided tours, in Catalan and Spanish only, on Saturdays and Sundays. The building is open for independent visiting on 11 September from 10am to 7pm. On show to the public are the sweeping Escala d’Honor (Stairway of Honour) and the several solemn halls that lead to the Saló de Sessions, the semicircular auditorium where parliament sits. In the lily pond at the centre of the garden in front of the building is a statue of a seemingly heartbroken woman, Desconsol (Distress; 1907), by Josep Llimona.The Passeig de Picasso side of the park is lined with several buildings constructed for, or just before, the Universal Exhibition. The medieval-looking caprice at the top end is the most engaging. Known as the Castell dels Tres Dragons (Castle of the Three Dragons), it long housed the Museu de Zoologia, which has since moved to the Fòrum area and is now known as the Museu Blau. Domènech i Montaner put the ‘castle’s’ trimmings on a pioneering steel frame. The coats of arms are all invented and the whole building exudes a teasing, playful air. It was used as a cafe-restaurant during the Universal Exhibition of 1888.To the south is L’Hivernacle, an elaborate greenhouse. Next come the former Museu de Geologia and L'Umbracle, a palm house. On Passeig de Picasso itself is Antoni Tàpies’ typically impenetrable Homenatge a Picasso . Water runs down the panes of a glass box full of bits of old furniture and steel girders.Northwest of the park, Passeig de Lluís Companys is capped by the Modernista Arc de Triomf , designed by Josep Vilaseca as the principal exhibition entrance, with unusual, Islamic-style brickwork. Josep Llimona did the main reliefs. Just what the triumph was eludes us, especially since the exhibition itself was a commercial failure. It is perhaps best thought of as a bricks-and-mortar embodiment of the city’s general fin-de-siècle feel-good factor.	150	2.18666559363	41.3879974625	5.5	1087	766	182	11	4	4.5	[]	['Nature & Parks']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	Fundació Joan Miró	Joan Miró, the city’s best-known 20th-century artistic progeny, bequeathed this art foundation to his hometown in 1971. Its light-filled buildings, designed by close friend and architect Josep Lluís Sert (who also built Miró’s Mallorca studios), are crammed with seminal works, from Miró’s earliest timid sketches to paintings from his last years.Sert's shimmering white temple to the art of one of the stars of the 20th-century Spanish firmament is considered one of the world's most outstanding museum buildings; the architect designed it after spending much of Franco's dictatorship years in the USA, as the head of the School of Design at Harvard University. The foundation rests amid the greenery of the mountain and holds the greatest single collection of the artist’s work, comprising around 220 of his paintings, 180 sculptures, some textiles and more than 8000 drawings spanning his entire life. Only a small portion is ever on display.The exhibits give a broad impression of Miró’s artistic development. The first couple of rooms (11 and 12) hold various works, including a giant tapestry in his trademark primary colours. Room 13, a basement space called Espai 13, leads you downstairs to a small room for temporary exhibitions.Next (oddly enough) comes room 16, the Sala Joan Prats, with works spanning the early years until 1931, entitled The Early Years and Paris and Surrealism. Here, you can see how the young Miró moved away, under surrealist influence, from his relative realism (for instance his 1917 painting Ermita de Sant Joan d’Horta ) towards his own unique style that uses primary colours and morphed shapes symbolising the moon, the female form and birds.This theme is continued upstairs in room 17, the Sala Pilar Juncosa (named after his wife), which covers the years 1932–55, his surrealist years. Rooms 18 and 19 contain masterworks of the years 1956–83, and room 20 a series of paintings done on paper. Room 21 hosts a selection of the private Katsuka collection of Miró works from 1914 to the 1970s. Room 22 rounds off the permanent exhibition with some major paintings and bronzes from the 1960s and 1970s. On the way here, you will see Mercury Fountain by Alexander Calder, a rebuilt work that was originally built for the 1937 Paris Fair and represented Spain at the Spanish Republic's Pavilion.The basement rooms 14 and 15, together labelled Homenatge a Joan Miró (Homage to Joan Miró), are dedicated to photos of the artist, a 15-minute video on his life and a series of works from some of his contemporaries, like Henry Moore, Antoni Tàpies, Eduardo Chillida, Yves Tanguy, Fernand Léger and others.The museum library contains Miró’s personal book collection.Outside on the eastern flank of the museum is the Jardí de les Escultures, a small garden with various pieces of modern sculpture (it is also a wi-fi zone). The green areas surrounding the museum, together with the garden, are perfect for a picnic in the shade, after a hard day's sightseeing.	150	2.15988002168	41.3687101556	5.5	746	418	141	38	25	4.5	[]	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	Camp Nou	Among Barcelona’s most-visited sites is the massive stadium of Camp Nou (which means New Field in Catalan), home to the legendary Futbol Club Barcelona. Attending a game amid the roar of the crowds is an unforgettable experience. Football fans who aren't able to see a game can get a taste of all the excitement at the museum, with its multimedia exhibits, and a self-guided tour of the stadium.The museum provides a high-tech view into the club, with massive touch-screens allowing visitors to explore arcane aspects of the legendary team. Giant touch screens allow interactive exploring, delving into the club's history, its social commitment and connection to Catalan identity as well as indepth stats of on-the-field action. Sound installations include the club's anthem (which you can hear in many languages, including Hindi) and match-day sounds from the stadium.The best bits of the museum itself are the photo section, the goal videos and the views out over the stadium. You can admire the (in at least one case literally) golden boots of great goal scorers of the past and learn about the greats who have played for Barça over the years, including Maradona, Ronaldinho, Kubala and many others.Gazing out across Camp Nou is an experience in itself. The stadium, built in 1957 and enlarged for the 1982 World Cup, is one of the world’s biggest, holding nearly 100,000 people. The club has a world-record membership of 173,000.The self-guided tour of the stadium takes in the team’s dressing rooms, heads out through the tunnel, onto the pitch and winds up in the presidential box. You'll also get to visit the television studio, the press room and the commentary boxes. Set aside about 2½ hours for the whole visit.Tickets to FC Barcelona matches are available at Camp Nou, online (through FC Barcelona's official website) as well as through various city locations. Tourist offices sell them (the branch at Plaça de Catalunya is a centrally located option) as do FC Botiga stores. Tickets can cost anything from €35 to upwards of €250, depending on the seat and match. On match day the ticket windows open weekdays from 9am until half time, on Saturdays from 10am until half time; on Sundays they open two hours before kick off through half time. Usually tickets are not available for matches with Real Madrid.You will almost definitely find scalpers lurking near the ticket windows. They are often club members and can sometimes get you in at a significant reduction. Don’t pay until you are safely seated.	90	2.122886347	41.380934	5.5	7453	3421	1101	234	114	4.5	['10:00 - 14:30', '34:00 - 42:30', '58:00 - 66:30', '82:00 - 90:30', '106:00 - 114:30', '130:00 - 138:30', '154:00 - 162:30']	['Arenas & Stadiums', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	Castell de Montjuïc	This forbidding castell (castle or fort) dominates the southeastern heights of Montjuïc and enjoys commanding views over the Mediterranean. It dates, in its present form, from the late 17th and 18th centuries. For most of its dark history, it has been used to watch over the city and as a political prison and killing ground.Anarchists were executed here around the end of the 19th century, fascists during the civil war and Republicans after it – most notoriously Lluís Companys in 1940. The castle is surrounded by a network of ditches and walls (from which its strategic position over the city and port become clear).Until 2009 the castle was home to a somewhat fusty old military museum, closed since the Ministry of Defence handed the fortress over to the city after protracted negotiations, although it is currently undergoing renovations and will be used as exhibition space. The artillery that once stood in the central courtyard has been removed, but some of the seaward big guns remain in place.In 2014 parts of the castle previously closed to the public – such as the tower and the dungeons – were opened, and an entrance fee was applied. A large part of the castle will now function as exhibition space, although the finer details had yet to be ironed out at the time of writing. The current exhibition explains something of the history of the place as well as detailing plans for its future. Perhaps when all this is done, the tombstones (some dating to the 11th century) from the one-time Jewish cemetery on Montjuïc will get a more imaginative exhibition space than the drab room once set aside for them in the military museum.The views from the castle and the surrounding area looking over the sea, port and city below are the best part of making the trip here. Around the seaward foot of the castle is an airy walking track, the Camí del Mar , which offers breezy views of the city and sea.From the Jardins del Mirador , opposite the Mirador (Telefèric) station, you have fine views over the port of Barcelona. A little further downhill, the Jardins de Joan Brossa are charming, landscaped gardens on the site of a former amusement park near Plaça de la Sardana . These gardens contain many Mediterranean species, from cypresses to pines and a few palms. There are swings and things, thematic walking trails and some good city views.	90	2.16633795084	41.3634865064	5.0	517	614	214	45	15	4.0	[]	['Castles', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	Museu-Monestir de Pedralbes	This peaceful old convent was first opened to the public in 1983 and is now a museum of monastic life (the few remaining nuns have moved into more modern neighbouring buildings). It stands at the top of Avinguda de Pedralbes in a residential area that was countryside until the 20th century, but which remains a divinely quiet corner of Barcelona.The architectural highlight is the large, elegant, three-storey cloister, a jewel of Catalan Gothic, built in the early 14th century. Following its course to the right, stop at the first chapel, the Capella de Sant Miquel, whose murals were done in 1346 by Ferrer Bassá, one of Catalonia’s earliest documented painters. A few steps on is the ornamental grave of Queen Elisenda, who founded the convent. It is curious, as it is divided in two: the side in the cloister shows her dressed as a penitent widow, while the other part, an alabaster masterpiece inside the adjacent church, shows her dressed as queen.As you head around the ground floor of the cloister, you can peer into the restored refectory, kitchen, stables, stores and a reconstruction of the infirmary – all giving a good idea of convent life. Eating in the refectory must not have been a whole lot of fun, judging by the exhortations to Silentium (Silence) and Audi Tacens (Listen and Keep Quiet) written around the walls. Harder still must have been spending one’s days in the cells on the ground and 1st floors in a state of near-perpetual prayer and devotional reading.Upstairs is a grand hall that was once the Dormidor (sleeping quarters). It was lined by tiny night cells but they were long ago removed. Today a modest collection of the monastery’s art, especially Gothic devotional works, and furniture grace this space. Most is by largely unknown Catalan artists, with some 16th-century Flemish works, and was acquired thanks to the considerable wealth of the convent’s mostly high-class nuns.Next to the convent, the sober church is an excellent example of Catalan Gothic.	120	2.11187421256	41.3954733805	5.5	110	73	14	1	2	4.5	[]	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	La Pedrera	This undulating beast is another madcap Gaudí masterpiece, built in 1905–10 as a combined apartment and office block. Formally called Casa Milà, after the businessman who commissioned it, it is better known as La Pedrera (the Quarry) because of its uneven grey stone facade, which ripples around the corner of Carrer de Provença.Pere Milà had married the older and far richer Roser Guardiola, the wealthy widow of Josep Guardiola, and knew how to spend his new wife's money – Milà was one of the city’s first car owners and Gaudí built parking space into this building, itself a first. When commissioned to design this apartment building, Gaudí wanted to top anything else done in L’Eixample.The Fundació Caixa Catalunya has opened the top-floor apartment, attic and roof, together called the Espai Gaudí (Gaudí Space), to visitors. The roof is the most extraordinary element, with its giant chimney pots looking like multicoloured medieval knights. Gaudí wanted to put a tall statue of the Virgin up here too: when the Milà family said no, fearing it might make the building a target for anarchists, Gaudí resigned from the project in disgust.One floor below the roof, where you can appreciate Gaudí’s taste for parabolic arches, is a modest museum dedicated to his work.The next floor down is the apartment (El Pis de la Pedrera). It is fascinating to wander around this elegantly furnished home, done up in the style a well-to-do family might have enjoyed in the early 20th century. The sensuous curves and unexpected touches in everything from light fittings to bedsteads, from door handles to balconies, might seem admirable to us today, but not everyone thought so at the time. The story goes that one tenant, a certain Mrs Comes i Abril, had complained that there was no obvious place to put her piano in these wavy rooms. Gaudí’s response was simple: ‘Madame, I suggest you take up the flute.’On hot August evenings, La Pedrera usually stages a series of brief concerts on the roof.	90	2.16188458998	41.3953275349	5.5	3998	2241	725	183	49	4.5	['33:00 - 46:00', '57:00 - 70:00', '81:00 - 94:00', '105:00 - 118:00', '129:00 - 142:00', '10:00 - 14:00', '154:00 - 158:00', '18:00 - 22:00', '162:00 - 166:00']	['Specialty Museums', 'Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Museums']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	Basílica de Santa Maria del Mar	At the southwest end of Passeig del Born stands the apse of Barcelona’s finest Catalan Gothic church, Santa Maria del Mar (Our Lady of the Sea). Built in the 14th century with record-breaking alacrity for the time (it took just 54 years), the church is remarkable for its architectural harmony and simplicity.Its construction started in 1329, with Berenguer de Montagut and Ramon Despuig being the architects in charge. During the construction, the city’s porters (bastaixos) spent a day each week carrying on their backs the stone required to build the church from royal quarries in Montjuïc. Their memory lives on in reliefs of them in the main doors and stone carvings elsewhere in the church. The walls, the side chapels and the facades were finished by 1350 and the entire structure was completed in 1383.The exterior of Santa Maria del Mar gives an impression of sternness, and like many of the buildings in the old part of town, it suffers from the impossibility of an overall perspective – the narrow streets around it are restrictive and claustrophobic. It may come as a (pleasant) surprise then, to find a spacious and light interior – the central nave and two flanking aisles separated by slender octagonal pillars give an enormous sense of lateral space.The interior is almost devoid of imagery of the sort to be found in Barcelona's other large Gothic churches, but Santa Maria was lacking in superfluous decoration even before anarchists gutted it in 1909 and 1936.Opposite the church’s southern flank, an eternal flame burns brightly over an apparently anonymous sunken square. This was once El Fossar de les Moreres (The Mulberry Cemetery), the site of a Roman cemetery. It’s also where Catalan resistance fighters were buried after the siege of Barcelona ended in defeat in September 1714.Keep an eye out for music recitals, often baroque and classical. In summer you can visit the roof terrace as part of a guided tour (€5)	90	2.18198905533	41.3838015152	5.5	3058	1450	284	32	12	4.5	[]	['Religious Sites', 'Historic Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	Casa Batlló	One of the strangest residential buildings in Europe, this is Gaudí at his hallucinogenic best. The facade, sprinkled with bits of blue, mauve and green tiles and studded with wave-shaped window frames and balconies, rises to an uneven blue-tiled roof with a solitary tower.It is one of the three houses on the block between Carrer del Consell de Cent and Carrer d’Aragó that gave it the playful name Manzana de la Discordia, meaning ‘Apple (Block) of Discord’. The others are Puig i Cadafalch’s Casa Amatller and Domènech i Montaner’s Casa Lleó Morera. They were all renovated between 1898 and 1906 and show how eclectic a ‘style’ Modernisme was.Locals know Casa Batlló variously as the casa dels ossos (house of bones) or casa del drac (house of the dragon). It’s easy enough to see why. The balconies look like the bony jaws of some strange beast and the roof represents Sant Jordi (St George) and the dragon. Even the roof was built to look like the shape of an animal’s back, with shiny scales – the 'spine' changes colour as you walk around. If you stare long enough at the building, it seems almost to be a living being. Before going inside, take a look at the pavement. Each paving piece carries stylised images of an octopus and a starfish, Gaudí designs originally cooked up for Casa Batlló.When Gaudí was commissioned to refashion this building, he went to town inside and out. The internal light wells shimmer with tiles of deep sea blue. Gaudí eschewed the straight line, and so the staircase wafts you up to the 1st (main) floor, where the salon looks on to Passeig de Gràcia. Everything swirls: the ceiling is twisted into a vortex around its sunlike lamp; the doors, window and skylights are dreamy waves of wood and coloured glass. The same themes continue in the other rooms and covered terrace. The attic is characterised by Gaudí trademark hyperboloid arches. Twisting, tiled chimney pots add a surreal touch to the roof.	90	2.16485165742	41.3915969858	4.5	13039	3918	900	183	85	4.5	['9:00 - 21:00', '33:00 - 45:00', '57:00 - 69:00', '81:00 - 93:00', '105:00 - 117:00', '129:00 - 141:00', '153:00 - 165:00']	['Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Architectural Buildings', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
spain	barcelona	Palau de la Música Catalana	This concert hall is a high point of Barcelona’s Modernista architecture, a symphony in tile, brick, sculpted stone and stained glass. Built by Domènech i Montaner between 1905 and 1908 for the Orfeo Català musical society, it was conceived as a temple for the Catalan Renaixença (Renaissance).The palace was built with the help of some of the best Catalan artisans of the time, in the cloister of the former Convent de Sant Francesc, and since 1990 it has undergone several major changes.The palau, like a peacock, shows off much of its splendour on the outside. Take in the principal facade with its mosaics, floral capitals and the sculpture cluster representing Catalan popular music. Wander inside the foyer and restaurant areas to admire the spangled, tiled pillars. Best of all, however, is the richly colourful auditorium upstairs, with its ceiling of blue-and-gold stained glass and shimmering skylight that looks like a giant, crystalline, downward-thrusting nipple. Above a bust of Beethoven on the stage towers a wind-blown sculpture of Wagner’s Valkyries (Wagner was top of the Barcelona charts at the time it was created). This can only be savoured on a guided tour or by attending a performance – either is highly recommended.The original Modernista creation, now a World Heritage site, did not meet with universal approval in its day. The doyen of Catalan literature, Josep Pla, did not hesitate to condemn it as ‘horrible’, but few share his sentiments today. Montaner himself was also in a huff. He failed to attend the opening ceremony in response to unsettled bills. In 2009 the palau was at the centre of a fraud scandal, as its president, who subsequently resigned, admitted to having syphoned off millions of euros of its funds.Admission is by guided tour, and tickets can be bought up to a week in advance by phone or online. Space is limited to a maximum of 55 people.	90	2.17516174968	41.3875420711	4.5	5654	1526	263	48	25	4.5	['33:00 - 45:00', '57:00 - 69:00', '81:00 - 93:00', '105:00 - 117:00', '129:00 - 141:00', '153:00 - 165:00']	['Theaters', 'Architectural Buildings', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Theater & Concerts']	False	activity
spain	barcelona	Fundación Francisco Godia	Francisco Godia (1921–90), head of one of Barcelona’s great establishment families, liked fast cars (he came sixth in the 1956 Grand Prix season driving Maseratis) and fine art. An intriguing mix of medieval art, ceramics and modern paintings make up this varied private collection.Housed in Casa Garriga Nogués, this is a stunning, carefully restored Modernista residence originally built for a rich banking family by Enric Sagnier in 1902–05.The ground floor is given over to a display of Godia’s driving trophies (and goggles) and a video on his feats behind the wheel, as well as occasional temporary exhibitions.The art is up the languidly curvaceous marble stairway on the 1st floor and organised along roughly chronological lines across 17 rooms. The first five are given over mostly to Romanesque and Gothic wooden sculptures. Some of these are especially arresting because of their well-preserved colouring. The early-14th-century wood cut of Joseph of Armithea (room 1), with its bright red, pyjama-like outfit, is a case in point. Jaume Huguet is represented in room 5 by Santa Maria Magdalena, a bright, Gothic representation of Mary Magdalene dressed in red ermine.Room 6 is a long and overwhelming rococo room with aqua-green walls and a selection of Godia’s extensive ceramics collection, with pieces from all the historic porcelain production centres in Spain (including Manises in Valencia and Talavera de la Reina in Castilla-La Mancha). Admire the fine Modernista stained-glass windows in room 8.Godia’s interests ranged from the Neapolitan baroque painter Luca Giordano to Catalan Modernisme and Valencia’s Joaquim Sorolla. Room 17, a gallery around the central staircase, contains several works by Modernista and Noucentista painters, like Ramon Casas, Santiago Rusiñol and Isidre Nonell. There’s even a modest Miró.	120	2.16534475	41.3888371	5.5	24	17	2	1	1	4.5	['10:00 - 20:00', '34:00 - 44:00', '58:00 - 68:00', '82:00 - 92:00', '106:00 - 116:00', '130:00 - 140:00', '154:00 - 164:00']	['Art Museums', 'Museums']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	Palau Güell	Finally reopened in its entirety in May 2012 after several years of refurbishment, this is a magnificent example of the early days of Gaudí’s fevered architectural imagination – the extraordinary neo-Gothic mansion, one of the few major buildings of that era raised in Ciutat Vella, gives an insight into its maker’s prodigious genius.Gaudí built the palace just off La Rambla in the late 1880s for his wealthy and faithful patron, the industrialist Eusebi Güell. Although a little sombre compared with some of his later whims, it is still a characteristic riot of styles (Gothic, Islamic, art nouveau) and materials. After the civil war the police occupied it and tortured political prisoners in the basement. The building was then abandoned, this leading to its long-term disrepair.Up two floors are the main hall and its annexes; central to the structure is the magnificent music room with its rebuilt organ that is played during opening hours. The hall is a parabolic pyramid – each wall an arch stretching up three floors and coming together to form a dome. The family rooms are sometimes labyrinthine and dotted with piercings of light, or grand, stained-glass affairs. The roof is a mad tumult of tiled mosaics and fanciful design in the building’s chimney pots. The audio guide, included in the entry price, is worth getting for its photo and music illustrations of Güell family life.Picasso – who, incidentally, hated Gaudí’s work – began his Blue Period in 1902 in a studio across the street at Carrer Nou de la Rambla 10. Begging to differ with Señor Picasso, Unesco declared the Palau, together with Gaudí’s other main works (La Sagrada Família, Casa Batlló, La Pedrera, Park Güell, Casa Vicens and Colònia Güell crypt) a World Heritage site.	90	2.17419096398	41.3788726533	5.5	3326	1572	442	69	36	4.5	['10:00 - 20:00', '58:00 - 68:00', '82:00 - 92:00', '106:00 - 116:00', '130:00 - 140:00', '154:00 - 164:00']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Historic Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	Poble Espanyol	Welcome to Spain! All of it! This ‘Spanish Village’ is both a cheesy souvenir hunters’ haunt and an intriguing scrapbook of Spanish architecture built for the Spanish crafts section of the 1929 World Exhibition. You can meander from Andalucía to the Balearic Islands in the space of a couple of hours, visiting surprisingly good copies of Spain's characteristic buildings.You enter from beneath a towered medieval gate from Ávila. Inside, to the right, is an information office with free maps. Straight ahead from the gate is the Plaza Mayor (Town Sq), surrounded with mainly Castilian and Aragonese buildings. It is sometimes the scene of summer concerts. Elsewhere you’ll find an Andalucian barrio, a Basque street, Galician and Catalan quarters, and even a Dominican monastery (at the eastern end). The buildings house dozens of restaurants, cafes, bars, craft shops and workshops (for glass artists and other artisans), and some souvenir stores.Spare some time for the Fundació Fran Daurel , an eclectic collection of 300 works of art including sculptures, prints, ceramics and tapestries by modern artists ranging from Picasso and Miró to more contemporary figures, including Miquel Barceló. The foundation also has a sculpture garden, boasting 27 pieces, nearby within the grounds of Poble Espanyol (look for the Montblanc gate). Frequent temporary exhibitions broaden the offerings further.At night the restaurants, bars and especially the discos become a lively corner of Barcelona’s nightlife.Children’s groups can participate in the Joc del Sarró. Accompanied by adults, the kids go around the poble seeking the answers to various mysteries outlined in a kit distributed to each group. Languages catered for include English.	150	2.14699116637	41.3686211055	3.5	311	352	229	140	110	3.5	['9:00 - 24:00', '33:00 - 44:00', '57:00 - 72:00', '81:00 - 96:00', '105:00 - 120:00', '129:00 - 147:00', '153:00 - 168:00', '0:00 - 4:00']	['Historic Sites', 'Visitor Centers', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Traveler Resources']	False	activity
spain	barcelona	Colònia Güell	Apart from La Sagrada Família, Gaudí’s last big project was the creation of a utopian textile workers’ complex for his magnate patron Eusebi Güell outside Barcelona at Santa Coloma de Cervelló. Gaudí’s main role was to erect the colony’s church, Colònia Güell. Work began in 1908 but the idea fizzled eight years later and Gaudí only finished the crypt, which still serves as a working church.This structure is a key to understanding what the master had in mind for his magnum opus, La Sagrada Família. The mostly brick-clad columns that support the ribbed vaults in the ceiling are inclined at all angles in much the way you might expect trees in a forest to lean. That effect was deliberate, but also grounded in physics. Gaudí worked out the angles so that their load would be transmitted from the ceiling to the earth without the help of extra buttressing. Similar thinking lay behind his plans for La Sagrada Família, whose Gothic-inspired structure would tower above any medieval building, without requiring a single buttress. Gaudí’s hand is visible down to the wavy design of the pews. The primary colours in the curvaceous plant-shaped stained-glass windows are another reminder of the era in which the crypt was built.Near the church spread the cute brick houses designed for the factory workers and still inhabited today. A short stroll away, the 23 factory buildings of a Modernista industrial complex, idle since the 1970s, were brought back to life in the early 2000s, with shops and businesses moving into the renovated complex.In a five-room display with audiovisual and interactive material, the history and life of the industrial colony and the story of Gaudí’s church are told in colourful fashion. 	90	2.02732086182	41.3626740441	5.5	150	84	20	0	2	4.5	[]	['Historic Sites', 'Architectural Buildings', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	El Fòrum	Once an urban wasteland, this area has seen dramatic changes in recent years, with sparkling new buildings, open plazas and waterfront recreation areas. The most striking element is the eerily blue, triangular 2001: A Space Odyssey –style Edifici Fòrum building by Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron.The facades look like sheer cliff faces, with angular crags cut into them as if by divine laser. Grand strips of mirror create fragmented reflections of the sky.Next door, Josep Lluís Mateo’s high-tech Centre de Convencions Internacional de Barcelona (CCIB) is a massive work in steel with intriguing contours.A 300m stroll east from the Edifici Fòrum is the Zona de Banys , with kayaks and bikes available for rent, the option to learn diving, and other activities. This tranquil seawater swimming area was won from the sea by the creation of massive cement-block dykes. At its northern end, like a great rectangular sunflower, an enormous photovoltaic panel turns its face up to the sun to power the area with solar energy. Along with another set of solar panels in the form of porticoes, it generates enough electricity for 1000 households. Just behind it spreads Port Fòrum , Barcelona’s third marina. The area is unified by an undulating esplanade and walkways (with wheelchair access) that are perfect for walking, wheelchair access, bikes and skateboards.In summer a weekend amusement park sets up with all the usual suspects: rides, shooting galleries, snack stands, inflatable castles and dodgem cars.The Parc de Diagonal Mar , designed by Enric Miralles, contains pools, fountains, a didactic botanical walk (with more than 30 species of trees and other plants) and modern sculptures.	90	2.22314357758	41.4111920196	3.5	8	11	8	4	2	3.5	[]	['Historic Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Nature & Parks']	False	activity
spain	barcelona	Fundació Antoni Tàpies	The Fundació Antoni Tàpies is both a pioneering Modernista building (completed in 1885) and the major collection of leading 20th-century Catalan artist Antoni Tàpies. A man known for his esoteric work, Tàpies died in February 2012, aged 88; he leaves behind a powerful range of paintings and a foundation intended to promote contemporary artists.The building, designed by Domènech i Montaner for the publishing house Editorial Montaner i Simón (run by a cousin of the architect), combines a brick-covered iron frame with Islamic-inspired decoration. Tàpies crowned it with the meanderings of his own mind, a work called Núvol i Cadira (Cloud and Chair) that spirals above the building like a storm.Although it's difficult to understand the art of Antoni Tàpies, it's worth seeing the one-hour documentary on his life, on the top floor, to understand his influences, method and the course of his interesting life. In his work, Tàpies expressed a number of themes, such as left-wing politics and humanitarianism; the practices of Zen meditation and its relationship between nature and insight; incarnation as seen in Christian faith; and art as alchemy or magic.He launched the Fundació in 1984 to promote contemporary art, donating a large part of his own work. The collection spans the arc of Tàpies’ creations (with more than 800 works) and contributions from other contemporary artists. In the main exhibition area (level 1, upstairs) you can see an ever-changing selection of around 20 of Tàpies’ works, from early self-portraits of the 1940s to grand items like Jersei Negre (Black Jumper; 2008). Level 2 hosts a small space for temporary exhibitions. Rotating exhibitions take place in the basement levels.	120	2.163802	41.391403	3.5	32	42	24	12	16	3.5	['10:00 - 19:00', '58:00 - 67:00', '82:00 - 91:00', '106:00 - 115:00', '130:00 - 139:00', '154:00 - 163:00']	['Art Museums', 'Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	False	activity
spain	barcelona	La Rambla	Barcelona's most famous street is both a tourist magnet and a window into Catalan culture, with cultural centres, theatres and architecturally intriguing buildings lining its sides. Set between narrow traffic lanes and flanked by plane trees, the middle of La Rambla is a broad pedestrian boulevard, crowded every day until the wee hours with a wide cross section of society. A stroll here is pure sensory overload, with souvenir hawkers, buskers, pavement artists, mimes and living statues all part of the ever-changing street scene.It takes its name from a seasonal stream (raml in Arabic) that once ran here. From the early Middle Ages on, it was better known as the Cagalell (Stream of Shit) and lay outside the city walls until the 14th century. Monastic buildings were then built and, subsequently, mansions of the well-to-do from the 16th to the early 19th centuries. Unofficially, La Rambla is divided into five sections, which explains why many know it as Las Ramblas.The initial stretch from Plaça de Catalunya is La Rambla de Canaletes , named after a turn-of-the-20th-century drinking fountain, the water of which supposedly emerges from what were once known as the springs of Canaletes. It used to be said that barcelonins ‘drank the waters of Les Canaletes’. Nowadays people claim that anyone who drinks from the fountain will return to Barcelona, which is not such a bad prospect. This is the traditional meeting point for happy FC Barcelona fans when they win cups and competitions.The second stretch, La Rambla dels Estudis (Carrer de la Canuda to Carrer de la Portaferrissa) is also called La Rambla dels Ocells (birds) because of its twittering bird market.	150	2.17412889004	41.3801857424	4.0	2734	2643	1559	599	293	4.0	[]	['Specialty & Gift Shops', 'Neighborhoods', 'Shopping', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
spain	barcelona	MACBA	Designed by Richard Meier and opened in 1995, MACBA has become the city's foremost contemporary art centre, with captivating exhibitions for the serious art lover. The permanent collection is on the ground floor and dedicates itself to Spanish and Catalan art from the second half of the 20th century, with works by Antoni Tàpies, Joan Brossa and Miquel Barceló, among others, though international artists, such as Paul Klee, Bruce Nauman and John Cage, are also represented.The gallery, across two floors, is dedicated to temporary visiting exhibitions that are almost always challenging and intriguing. MACBA's 'philosophy' is to do away with the old model of a museum where an art work is a spectacle and to create a space where art can be viewed critically, so the exhibitions are usually tied in with talks and events. If you're after some serious brain candy, MACBA is your place.Outside, the spectacle is as intriguing as inside. While skateboarders dominate the space south of the museum (considered one of Europe’s great skateboard locations), you may well find Pakistani kids enjoying a game of cricket in Plaça de Joan Coromines.Across the main skateboard-infested square, the renovated 400-year-old Convent dels Àngels houses the Capella Macba, where the MACBA regularly rotates selections from its permanent collection. The Gothic framework of the one-time convent-church remains intact.The library and auditorium stage regular concerts, talks and events, all of which are either reasonably priced or free. The extensive art bookshop is fantastic for both stocking up on art and art theory books, as well as quirky gifts and small design objects.	120	2.16638803482	41.3831280502	3.5	103	108	85	74	54	3.5	['10:00 - 15:00', '35:00 - 43:30', '83:00 - 91:30', '107:00 - 115:30', '131:00 - 139:30', '154:00 - 165:00']	['Art Museums', 'Museums']	False	activity
spain	barcelona	Gran Teatre del Liceu	If you can’t catch a night at the opera, you can still have a look around one of Europe’s greatest opera houses, known to locals as the Liceu. Smaller than Milan’s La Scala but bigger than Venice’s La Fenice, it can seat up to 2300 people in its grand horseshoe auditorium.Built in 1847, the Liceu launched such Catalan stars as Josep (aka José) Carreras and Montserrat Caballé. Fire virtually destroyed it in 1994, but city authorities were quick to get it back into operation. Carefully reconstructing the 19th-century auditorium and installing the latest in theatre technology, technicians finalised its restoration in October 1999. You can take a 20-minute guided tour around the main public areas of the theatre or join a longer guided tour.On the 80-minute tour you are taken to the grand foyer, with its thick pillars and sumptuous chandeliers, and then up the marble staircase to the Saló dels Miralls (Hall of Mirrors). These both survived the 1994 fire and the latter was traditionally where theatregoers mingled during intermission. With mirrors, ceiling frescoes, fluted columns and high-and-mighty phrases in praise of the arts, it all exudes a typically neobaroque richness worthy of its 19th-century patrons. You are then led up to the 4th-floor stalls to admire the theatre itself.The tour also takes in a collection of Modernista art, El Cercle del Liceu, which contains works by Ramon Casas. It is possible to book special tours, one that is similar to the guided tour described but including a half-hour music recital on the Saló dels Miralls, and another tour that penetrates the inner workings of the stage and backstage work areas.	90	2.173448	41.380327	5.5	178	90	14	9	11	4.5	['9:30 - 18:30', '33:30 - 42:30', '57:30 - 66:30', '81:30 - 90:30', '105:30 - 114:30', '129:30 - 138:30', '153:30 - 162:30']	['Operas', 'Theaters', 'Theater & Concerts']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	MUHBA Refugi 307	Part of the Museu d'Història de Barcelona (MUHBA), this is a shelter that dates back to the days of the Spanish Civil War. Barcelona was the city most heavily bombed from the air during the Spanish Civil War and had more than 1300 air-raid shelters. Local citizens started digging this one under a fold of Montjuïc in March 1937.In the course of the next two years, the web of tunnels was slowly extended to 200m, with a theoretical capacity for 2000 people. People were not allowed to sleep overnight in the shelter – when raids were not being carried out work continued on its extension. Vaulted to displace the weight above the shelter to the clay brick walls (clay is porous, which allowed the bricks to absorb the shock waves of falling bombs without cracking), the tunnels were narrow and winding. Coated in lime to seal out humidity and whitewashed to relieve the sense of claustrophobia, they became a second home for many El Poble Sec folks.When the civil war ended, Franco had some extensions made because he considered the option of entering WWII on Hitler’s side. When he decided not to join the war, this and other shelters were largely abandoned. In the tough years of famine and rationing during the 1940s and 1950s, families from Granada took up residence here rather than in the shacks springing up all over the area, as poor migrants arrived from southern Spain. Later on, an enterprising fellow grew mushrooms here for sale on the black market.The half-hour tours (in Catalan or Spanish; book ahead for English or French) explain all this and more.	120	2.166579934	41.37147138	5.0	7	2	0	0	0	5.0	[]	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	False	activity
spain	barcelona	Palau de la Generalitat	Founded in the early 15th century, the Palau de la Generalitat is open on limited occasions only (the second and fourth weekends of the month, plus open-door days). The most impressive of the ceremonial halls is the Saló de Sant Jordi , named after St George, the region's patron saint. To see inside, book on the website (unfortunately in Catalan only).Marc Safont designed the original Gothic main entrance on Carrer del Bisbe. The modern main entrance on Plaça de Sant Jaume is a late-Renaissance job with neoclassical leanings. If you wander by in the evening, squint up through the windows into the Saló de Sant Jordi (Hall of St George) and you will get some idea of the sumptuousness of the interior.If you do get inside, you’re in for a treat. Normally you will have to enter from Carrer de Sant Sever. The first rooms you pass through are characterised by low vaulted ceilings. From here you head upstairs to the raised courtyard known as the Pati dels Tarongers, a modest Gothic orangery (opened about once a month for concert performances of the palace’s chimes). The 16th-century Sala Daurada i de Sessions, one of the rooms leading off the patio, is a splendid meeting hall lit up by huge chandeliers. Still more imposing is the Renaissance Saló de Sant Jordi, the murals of which were added last century – many an occasion of pomp and circumstance takes place here. Finally, you descend the staircase of the Gothic Pati Central to leave by what was, in the beginning, the building’s main entrance.	90	2.1767437724	41.3828674108	3.5	4	5	11	5	0	3.5	[]	['Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
spain	barcelona	Platjes	A series of pleasant beaches stretches northeast from the Port Olímpic marina. They are largely artificial, but this doesn’t stop an estimated seven million bathers from piling in every year!The southernmost beach, Platja de la Nova Icària , is the busiest. Behind it, across the Avinguda del Litoral highway, is the Plaça dels Campions, site of the rusting three-tiered platform used to honour medallists in the sailing events of the 1992 games. Much of the athletes’ housing-turned-apartments are in the blocks immediately behind Carrer de Salvador Espriu.The next beach is Platja de Bogatell . Just in from the beach is the Cementiri del Poblenou , created in 1773. It was positioned outside the then city limits for health reasons. Its central monument commemorates the victims of a yellow-fever epidemic that swept across Barcelona in 1821. The cemetery is full of bombastic family memorials, but an altogether disquieting touch is the sculpture El Petó de la Mort (The Kiss of Death), in which a winged skeleton kisses a young kneeling lifeless body. There’s a good skateboard area with half-pipes at the north end of the beach.Platja de la Mar Bella (with its brief nudist strip and sailing school) and Platja de la Nova Mar Bella follow, leading into the new residential and commercial waterfront strip, the Front Marítim, part of the Diagonal Mar project in the Fòrum district. It is fronted by the last of these artificial beaches to be created, Platja del Llevant .		2.212064808	41.39835252	None							[]	[]		activity
spain	barcelona	Casa Amatller	One of Puig i Cadafalch’s most striking bits of Modernista fantasy, Casa Amatller combines Gothic window frames with a stepped gable borrowed from Dutch urban architecture. But the busts and reliefs of dragons, knights and other characters dripping off the main facade are pure caprice.The pillared foyer and staircase lit by stained glass are like the inside of some romantic castle.The building was renovated in 1900 for the chocolate baron and philanthropist Antoni Amatller (1851–1910) and it will one day open partly to the public. Renovation – still continuing at the time of research – will see the 1st (main) floor converted into a museum with period pieces, while the 2nd floor will house the Institut Amatller d’Art Hispanic (Amatller Institute of Hispanic Art).For now, you can wander into the foyer, admire the staircase and lift, and head through the shop to see the latest temporary exhibition out the back. Depending on the state of renovation, it is also possible to join a 1½-hour guided tour of the 1st floor, with its early-20th-century furniture and decor intact, and Amatller’s photo studio. These are generally held on Saturdays; check the website for details.Amatller was a keen traveller and photographer (his absorbing shots of turn-of-the-20th-century Morocco are occasionally on show). The tour also includes a tasting of Amatller chocolates in the original kitchen.	90	2.165369	41.391459	5.5	56	43	9	2	0	4.5	[]	['Architectural Buildings', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	Ajuntament	The ajuntament, otherwise known as the Casa de la Ciutat, has been the seat of power for centuries. The Consell de Cent (the city’s ruling council) first sat here in the 14th century, but the building has lamentably undergone many changes since the days of Barcelona’s Gothic-era splendour.Only the original, now disused, entrance on Carrer de la Ciutat retains its Gothic ornament. The main 19th-century neoclassical facade on the square is a charmless riposte to the Palau de la Generalitat. Inside, the Saló de Cent is the hall in which the town council once held its plenary sessions. The broad vaulting is pure Catalan Gothic and the artesonado (Mudéjar wooden ceiling with interlaced beams leaving a pattern of spaces for decoration) demonstrates fine work. In fact, much of what you see is comparatively recent. The building was badly damaged in a bombardment in 1842 and has been repaired and tampered with repeatedly. The wooden neo-Gothic seating was added at the beginning of the 20th century, as was the grand alabaster retablo (retable, or altarpiece) at the back. To the right you enter the small Saló de la Reina Regente, built in 1860, where the ajuntament now sits. To the left of the Saló de Cent is the Saló de les Croniques – the murals here recount Catalan exploits in Greece and the Near East in Catalonia’s empire-building days.		2.177353	41.382379	None							[]	[]		activity
spain	barcelona	Museu Frederic Marès	One of the wildest collections of historical curios lies inside this vast medieval complex, once part of the royal palace of the counts of Barcelona. A rather worn coat of arms on the wall indicates that it was also, for a while, the seat of the Spanish Inquisition in Barcelona. Frederic Marès i Deulovol (1893-1991) was a rich sculptor, traveller and obsessive collector, and displays of religious art and vast varieties of bric-a-brac litter the museum.Frederic Marès specialised in medieval Spanish sculpture, huge quantities of which are displayed in the basement and on the ground and 1st floors – including some lovely polychrome wooden sculptures of the Crucifixion and the Virgin. Among the most eye-catching pieces is a reconstructed Romanesque doorway with four arches, taken from a 13th-century country church in the Aragonese province of Huesca.The top two floors hold a mind-boggling array of knick-knacks, from toy soldiers and cribs to scissors and 19th-century playing cards, and from early still cameras to pipes and fine ceramics. A room that once served as Marès’ study and library is now crammed with sculpture. The shady courtyard houses a pleasant summer cafe (Cafè de l’Estiu) and a series of interactive screens that allow visitors to get an idea of the collection while the museum remains closed.	120	2.176623	41.384384	4.0	67	52	22	3	5	4.0	['11:00 - 20:00', '58:00 - 67:00', '82:00 - 91:00', '106:00 - 115:00', '130:00 - 139:00', '154:00 - 163:00']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	False	activity
spain	barcelona	Jardins del Laberint d’Horta	Laid out in the twilight years of the 18th century by Antoni Desvalls, Marquès d’Alfarras i de Llupià, this carefully manicured park remained a private family idyll until the 1970s, when it was opened to the public. Many a fine party and theatrical performance was held here over the years, but it now serves as a kind of museum-park. The gardens take their name from a maze in their centre, but other paths take you past a pleasant artificial lake (estany), waterfalls, a neoclassical pavilion and a false cemetery. The last is inspired by 19th-century romanticism, characterised by an obsession with a swooning, anaemic (some might say silly) vision of death. The labyrinth, in the middle of these cool gardens (somehow odd in this environment, with modern apartments and ring roads nearby), can be surprisingly frustrating! Aim to reach the centre from the bottom end, and then exit towards the ponds and neoclassical pavilion. This is a good one for kids. Scenes of the film adaptation of Patrick Süsskind’s novel Perfume were shot in the gardens. To reach the gardens, take the right exit upstairs at Mundet Metro station; on emerging, turn right and then left along the main road (with football fields on your left) and then the first left uphill to the gardens (about five minutes).	90	2.23233508	41.42235941	5.5	272	192	43	5	4	4.5	[]	['Nature & Parks']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	Plaça d’Espanya & Around	The whirling roundabout of Plaça d’Espanya, distinguished by its so-called Venetian towers (because they are vaguely reminiscent of the belltower in Venice’s St Mark’s Square), was built for the 1929 World Exhibition and is the junction of several major thoroughfares.It is flanked on its northern side by the facade of the former Les Arenes bullring. Built in 1900 and once one of three bullrings in the city, it was recently converted into a shopping and leisure centre by Lord Richard Rogers. There are good views of the city from its 4th-floor rooftop terrace.Behind the bullring is the Parc de Joan Miró , created in the 1980s – worth a quick detour for Miró’s phallic sculpture Dona i Ocell (Woman and Bird) in the western corner. Locals know the park (which apart from the Miró is a dispiriting affair) as the Parc de l’Escorxador (Abattoir Park), after the slaughterhouse that once stood here – unsurprisingly given the proximity to the bullring.A couple of blocks west and just south of Estació Sants is Parc d'Espanya Industrial . With its ponds, little waterfalls, green spaces, trees, children’s swings, bar, and the odd towers that look for all the world like sci-fi prison-camp searchlight towers, it is a strange park indeed.	90	2.1492	41.375037	5.5	527	451	118	16	6	4.5	[]	['Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	Carrer de Montcada	An early example of town planning, this medieval high street was driven towards the sea from the road that in the 12th century led northeast from the city walls. It was the city's most coveted address for the merchant classes. The bulk of the great mansions that remain today mostly date to the 14th and 15th centuries.This area was the commercial heartland of medieval Barcelona. Five of the mansions on the east side of the street have been linked to house the Museu Picasso. Across the road, others house what is to become the Museu de Cultures del Món in 2015. Several other mansions on this street are commercial art galleries where you’re welcome to browse. If you promise to drink, you can sip wine or cocktails (both rather expensive) inside the baroque courtyard of the originally medieval Palau de Dalmases at No 20 while listening to baroque music or operatic snippets (a peek inside isn't allowed without a definitive commitment to consume when you enter!).At the corner of Carrer dels Corders and the northern end of the street, just beyond the 19th-century Carrer de la Princesa, stands a much-meddled-with Romanesque chapel, the Capella d’en Marcús , once a wayfarers’ stop on the road northeast out of medieval Barcelona.	90	2.181344	41.384827	4.5	19	16	4	0	0	4.5	['57:00 - 67:00', '81:00 - 91:00', '105:00 - 117:30', '9:00 - 19:00', '129:00 - 139:00', '153:00 - 163:00']	['Historic Walking Areas', 'Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
spain	barcelona	Cosmocaixa	Kids (and kids at heart) are fascinated by displays here and this science museum has become one of the city’s most popular attractions. The single greatest highlight is the recreation over 1 sq km of a chunk of flooded Amazon rainforest (Bosc Inundat). More than 100 species of Amazon flora and fauna (including anacondas, colourful poisonous frogs and caymans) prosper in this unique, living diorama in which you can even experience a tropical downpour.In another original section, the Mur Geològic, seven great chunks of rock (90 tonnes in all) have been assembled to create a ‘geological wall’.These and other displays on the lower 5th floor (the bulk of the museum is underground) cover many fascinating areas of science, from fossils to physics, and from the alphabet to outer space. To gain access to other special sections, such as the Planetari (planetarium), check for guided visits.

spain	barcelona	Antic Hospital de la Santa Creu	Behind La Boqueria stands the Antic Hospital de la Santa Creu, which was once the city’s main hospital. Begun in 1401, it functioned until the 1930s, and was considered one of the best in Europe in its medieval heyday – it is famously the place where Antoni Gaudí died in 1926. Today it houses the Biblioteca de Catalunya , and the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (Institute for Catalan Studies). The hospital’s Gothic chapel, La Capella , shows temporary exhibitions.Entering from Carrer de l’Hospital, you find yourself in a peaceful courtyard garden with a cheerful bar-cafe. Off the garden lies the entrance to the prestigious Massana conservatorium and, up a sweep of stairs, the library. Approaching the complex from Carrer del Carme or down a narrow lane from Jardins del Doctor Fleming (the little playground), you arrive at the entrance to the institute, which was once the 17th-century Casa de Convalescència de Sant Pau. The public can visit the patio, in the centre of which you'll find a statue of St Paul. The building (especially the entrance vestibule) is richly decorated with ceramics. Situated up on the 1st floor at the far end is what was once an orange garden, now named after the Catalan novelist Mercè Rodoreda.	90	2.169789	41.381003	4.5	4	4	1	0	0	4.5	[]	['Architectural Buildings', 'Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
spain	barcelona	Pavelló Mies van der Rohe	The Pavelló Mies van der Rohe is not only a work of breathtaking beauty and simplicity, it is a highly influential building emblematic of the modern movement. The structure has been the subject of many studies and interpretations, and it has inspired several generations of architects.Designed in 1929 by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (1886–1969) as the Pavelló Alemany (German Pavilion) for the World Exhibition, it was removed after the show and reconstructed only in 1980, after the building had been consistently referred to as one of the key works of modern architecture. The Pavelló was built using glass, steel and marble, reflecting Mies van der Rohe's originality in the use of materials – he admired their visual rigour and precision, and their embodiment of modernity.Mies van der Rohe also designed the Barcelona Chair for the pavilion, an iconic piece of furniture that can be seen in design-conscious spaces across the world today. Watch out for the graceful copy of a statue of Alba (Dawn) by Berlin sculptor Georg Kolbe (1877–1947) in one of the exterior areas.There is a free English guided tour on Saturdays at 10am.	90	2.1499637352	41.3705531486	5.5	175	67	32	8	5	4.5	['10:00 - 20:00', '34:00 - 44:00', '58:00 - 68:00', '82:00 - 92:00', '106:00 - 116:00', '130:00 - 140:00', '154:00 - 164:00']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	Mercat de Santa Caterina	Come shopping for your tomatoes at this extraordinary-looking produce market, designed by Enric Miralles and Benedetta Tagliabue to replace its 19th-century predecessor. Finished in 2005, it is distinguished by its kaleidoscopic and undulating roof, held up above the bustling produce stands, restaurants, cafes and bars by twisting slender branches of what look like grey steel trees.The multicoloured ceramic roof (with a ceiling made of warm, light wood) recalls the Modernista tradition of trencadís decoration (a type of mosaic, such as that in Park Güell). Indeed, its curvy design, like a series of Mediterranean rollers, seems to plunge back into an era when Barcelona’s architects were limited only by their (vivid) imagination. The market roof bears an uncanny resemblance to that of the Escoles de Gaudí at La Sagrada Família.The market’s 1848 predecessor had been built over the remains of the demolished 15th-century Gothic Monestir de Santa Caterina, a powerful Dominican convent. The Espai Santa Caterina , a small section of the church foundations, is glassed over in one corner as an archaeological reminder.		2.17847043724	41.3862792193	5.5	113	97	19	1	2	4.5	[]	['Specialty & Gift Shops', 'Shopping']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	Cementiri del Sud-Oest	On the hill to the south of the Anella Olímpica stretches this huge cemetery, the Cementiri del Sud-Oest (or 'Cementiri Nou'), which extends down the southern side of the hill. Opened in 1883, it’s an odd combination of elaborate architect-designed tombs for rich families and small niches for the rest. It includes the graves of numerous Catalan artists and politicians, and, at the entrance, the Col·lecció de Carrosses Fúnebres.Among the big names are Joan Miró, Carmen Amaya (the flamenco dance star from La Barceloneta), Jacint Verdaguer (the 19th-century priest and poet to whom the rebirth of Catalan literature is attributed), Francesc Macià and Lluís Companys (nationalist presidents of Catalonia; Companys was executed by Franco’s henchmen in the Castell de Montjuïc in 1940), Ildefons Cerdà (who designed L’Eixample) and Joan Gamper (the founder of the FC Barcelona football team, aka Hans Gamper). Many victims of Franco’s postwar revenge were buried in unmarked graves here – the last of them in 1974. Both buses 9 and 21 stop around 10 minutes' walk away – the cemetery is easy to spot.		2.156475	41.35816	None							[]	[]		activity
spain	barcelona	Museu de la Xocolata	Chocoholics have a hard time containing themselves in this museum dedicated to the fundamental foodstuff – particularly when faced with tempting displays of cocoa-based treats in the cafe at the exit. The displays trace the origins of chocolate, its arrival in Europe, and the many myths and images associated with it. Among the informative stuff and machinery used in the production of chocolate are large chocolate models of emblematic buildings such as the Sagrada Família, along with various characters, local and international. Kids and grown-ups can join guided tours and occasionally take part in chocolate-making and tasting sessions, especially on weekends. Alongside the Gothic arches of what remains of the convent’s one-time cloister is a pleasant cafe-bar, the Bar del Convent (open 10am to 9pm Monday to Thursday, 11am to 11pm Friday, Sunday, 1pm to midnight Saturday) – particularly good for people with children. Kids often play football in the cloister grounds, and there are children's books and toys in the cafe itself.

spain	barcelona	Recinte Modernista de Sant Pau	Domènech i Montaner outdid himself as architect and philanthropist with the Modernista Hospital de la Santa Creu i de Sant Pau, redubbed in 2014 the 'Recinte Modernista'. It was long considered one of the city’s most important hospitals, and only recently repurposed, its various spaces becoming cultural centres, offices and something of a monument. The complex, including 16 pavilions – together with the Palau de la Música Catalana, a joint World Heritage site – is lavishly decorated and each pavilion is unique.Domènech i Montaner wanted to create an environment that would also cheer up patients. Among artists who contributed statuary, ceramics and artwork was the prolific Eusebi Arnau. The hospital facilities have been transferred to a new complex on the premises, freeing up the century-old structures, which are being restored to their former glory in a plan to convert the complex into an international centre on the Mediterranean.Guided tours are available (€14/€9.80) in a variety of languages, upon request.	90	2.174425598	41.41367712	5.5	904	371	54	17	9	4.5	['10:00 - 14:30', '34:00 - 42:30', '58:00 - 66:30', '82:00 - 90:30', '106:00 - 114:30', '130:00 - 138:30', '154:00 - 162:30']	['Theaters', 'Architectural Buildings', 'Theater & Concerts', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	Museu Etnològic	Barcelona’s ethnology museum presents a curious permanent collection that explores how various societies have worked down the centuries, as seen through collections of all sorts of objects. The entire museum was closed at the time of writing for major refurbishments. Check the website for reopening date.Prior to the refurbishment, the museum started with a general look at ethnology in an introductory section, Orígens (Origins). Thereafter, collections covered the Pyrenees region in Catalonia (including traditional instruments and archive images of traditional dances) and Salamanca in central Spain, looking at a now largely extinct rural society. Further collections explored other regions around the world, but these are to be ceded to the new Museu de Cultures del Món, which will open in the Born in 2015. The museum typically displays only a fraction of its collections at a time, showcasing a number of countries at different intervals, including for temporary exhibitions.	120	2.15634338034	41.368790221	5.5	27	14	5	1	1	4.5	['10:00 - 20:00', '58:00 - 66:00', '82:00 - 90:00', '106:00 - 114:00', '130:00 - 138:00', '154:00 - 162:00']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	Sinagoga Major	When an Argentine investor bought a run-down electrician’s store with an eye to converting it into central Barcelona’s umpteenth bar, he could hardly have known he had stumbled onto the remains of what could be the city’s main medieval synagogue (some historians cast doubt on the claim). A guide will explain what is thought to be the significance of the site in various languages.Fragments of medieval and Roman-era walls remain in the small vaulted space that you enter from the street. Also remaining are tanners’ wells installed in the 15th century. The second chamber has been spruced up for use as a synagogue. A remnant of late-Roman-era wall here, given its orientation facing Jerusalem, has led some to speculate that there was a synagogue here even in Roman times. There were four synagogues in the medieval city, but after the pogroms of 1391, this one (assuming it was the Sinagoga Major) was Christianised by the placing of an effigy of St Dominic on the building.	90	2.17574292504	41.3826296818	4.0	6	12	2	2	0	4.0	[]	['Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
spain	barcelona	Església de Santa Maria del Pi	This striking 14th-century church is a classic of Catalan Gothic, with an imposing facade, a wide interior and a single nave. The simple decor in the main sanctuary contrasts with the gilded chapels and exquisite stained-glass windows that bathe the interior in ethereal light. The beautiful rose window above its entrance is one of the world’s largest. Occasional concerts are staged here (classical guitar, choral groups, chamber orchestras).The third chapel on the left is dedicated to Sant Josep Oriol, who was parish priest here from 1687 to 1702. The chapel has a map showing the places in the church where he worked numerous miracles (he was canonised in 1909). According to legend, a 10th-century fisherman discovered an image of the Virgin Mary in a pi (pine tree) that he was intent on cutting down to build a boat. Struck by the vision, he instead built a little chapel, later to be succeeded by this Gothic church. A pine still grows in the square outside the church.	90	2.17398629453	41.3821969086	5.0	69	83	17	7	3	4.0	['9:30 - 20:30', '33:30 - 44:30', '57:30 - 68:30', '81:30 - 92:30', '105:30 - 116:30', '129:30 - 140:30', '153:30 - 164:30']	['Churches & Cathedrals', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	Museu d'Arqueologia de Catalunya	This archaeology museum, housed in what was the Graphic Arts palace during the 1929 World Exhibition, covers Catalonia and cultures from elsewhere in Spain. Items range from copies of pre-Neanderthal skulls to lovely Carthaginian necklaces and jewel-studded Visigothic crosses.There’s good material on the Balearic Islands (rooms X to XIII) and Empúries (Emporion, the Greek and Roman city on the Costa Brava; rooms XIV and XVII). The Roman finds upstairs were mostly dug up in and around Barcelona. The most beautiful piece is a mosaic depicting Les Tres Gràcies (The Three Graces), unearthed near Plaça de Sant Jaume in the 18th century. Another is of Bellerophon and the Chimera. In the final room, dedicated to the dying centuries of the Roman world, a beautiful golden disk depicting Medusa stands out. The museum has been renovated slowly over recent years, and the displays are now updated with a more modern design and interactive displays.	120	2.15767060778	41.3697727585	4.0	10	9	4	1	1	4.0	[]	['History Museums', 'Historic Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Museums']	False	activity

All up, some 11,000 fish (including a dozen sharks) of 450 species reside here.Back in the shark tunnel, which you reach after passing a series of themed fish tanks with everything from bream to sea horses, various species of shark (white tip, sand tiger, bonnethead, black tip, nurse and sandbar) flit around you, along with a host of other critters, from flapping rays to bloated sunfish. An interactive zone, Planeta Aqua, is host to a family of Antarctic penguins and a tank of rays that you watch close up.Divers with a valid dive certificate may dive in the main tank with the sharks.	150	2.18438514872	41.3768419197	3.5	604	786	785	310	179	3.5	[]	['Nature & Parks', 'Zoos & Aquariums']	False	activity
spain	barcelona	Plaça Reial	One of the most photogenic squares in Barcelona, the Plaça Reial is a delightful retreat from the traffic and pedestrian mobs on the nearby Rambla. Numerous eateries, bars and nightspots lie beneath the arcades of 19th-century neoclassical buildings, with a buzz of activity at all hours.It was created on the site of a convent, one of several destroyed along La Rambla (the strip was teeming with religious institutions) in the wake of the Spain-wide disentailment laws that stripped the Church of much of its property. The lamp posts by the central fountain are Antoni Gaudí’s first known works in the city.The southern half of the Barri Gòtic is imbued with the memory of Picasso, who lived as a teenager with his family in Carrer de la Mercè, had his first studio in Carrer de la Plata and was a regular visitor to a brothel at Carrer d’Avinyó 27. That experience may have inspired his 1907 painting Les Demoiselles d’Avignon .	90	2.175261	41.380077	5.0	216	253	114	8	7	4.0	[]	['Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity

Next is the Mercat de la Boqueria , one of the best-stocked and most colourful produce markets in Europe.

Among its guests have been King Alfonso XIII, the president of Catalonia and General Franco.

spain	barcelona	Església de Sants Just i Pastor	This somewhat neglected, single-nave church, with chapels on either side of the buttressing, was built in 1342 in Catalan Gothic style on what is reputedly the site of the oldest parish church in Barcelona. Inside, you can admire some fine stained-glass windows. In front of it, in a pretty little square that was used as a set (a smelly Parisian marketplace) in 2006 for Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, is what is claimed to be the city’s oldest Gothic fountain.On the morning of 11 September 1924, Antoni Gaudí was arrested as he attempted to enter the church from this square to attend Mass. In those days of the dictatorship of General Primo de Rivera, it took little to ruffle official feathers, and Gaudí’s refusal to speak Spanish to the overbearing Guardia Civil officers who had stopped him earned him the better part of a day in the cells until a friend came to bail him out.	90	2.17818413199	41.3828246147	4.5	3	4	0	0	0	4.5	['10:00 - 13:00', '41:00 - 45:00', '35:00 - 38:00', '59:00 - 62:00', '83:00 - 86:00', '107:00 - 110:00', '131:00 - 134:00', '155:00 - 158:00', '65:00 - 68:00', '89:00 - 93:00', '113:00 - 117:00', '137:00 - 141:00', '161:00 - 165:00']	['Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity

The other downside: it's a long walk to a train station, though many buses pass near (including bus 22 and bus 58 from Plaça de Catalunya).	150	2.126541	41.409132	5.5	78	36	8	1	1	4.5	['34:00 - 43:00', '58:00 - 67:00', '82:00 - 91:00', '106:00 - 115:00', '130:00 - 139:00', '154:00 - 163:00']	['Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	Montjuïc	Southwest of the city centre and with views out to sea and over the city, Montjuïc serves as a Central Park of sorts and is a great place for a jog or stroll. It's dominated by the Castell de Montjuïc , a one-time fortress with great views. Buses 50, 55 and 61 all head up here. A local bus, the PM (Parc de Montjuïc) line, does a circle trip from Plaça d'Espanya to the castell. Cable cars and a funicular line also access the area.Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya is a broad panoply of Catalan and European art. The Romanesque frescos are truly stunning.Fundació Joan Miró is the definitive museum showcasing Joan Miró's works.A showcase of typical Spanish architecture from around the country, Poble Espanyol has craft shops, restaurants and nightlife.	120	None	None	5.5	2471	1799	385	45	22	4.5	[]	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	Font Màgica	A huge fountain that crowns the long sweep of the Avinguda de la Reina Maria Cristina to the grand facade of the Palau Nacional, Font Màgica is a unique performance in which the water can look like seething fireworks or a mystical cauldron of colour.It is wonderful that an idea that was cooked up for the 1929 World Exposition has, since the 1992 Olympics, again become a magnet. With a flourish, the ‘Magic Fountain’ erupts into a feast of musical, backlit aquatic life. On hot summer evenings especially, this 15-minute spectacle (repeated several times throughout the evening) mesmerises onlookers. On the last evening of the Festes de la Mercè in September, a particularly spectacular display includes fireworks.	90	2.15173281	41.37115698	5.5	6639	2503	803	209	142	4.5	['21:00 - 23:30', '117:00 - 119:30', '141:00 - 143:30', '165:00 - 167:30']	['Fountains', 'Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Theater & Concerts', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
spain	barcelona	Plaça de Sant Jaume	In the 2000 or so years since the Romans settled here, the area around this square (often remodelled), which started life as the forum, has been the focus of Barcelona’s civic life. This is still the central staging area for Barcelona's traditonal festivals. Facing each other across the square are the Palau de la Generalitat (seat of Catalonia’s regional government) on the north side and the ajuntament (town hall) to the south.Behind the ajuntament rise the awful town hall offices built in the 1970s over Plaça de Sant Miquel. Opposite is a rare 15th-century gem, Casa Centelles , on the corner of Baixada de Sant Miquel. You can wander into the fine Gothic-Renaissance courtyard if the gates are open.	90	2.177052	41.382669	4.0	5	14	2	0	0	4.0	[]	['Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity

Temporary exhibitions, usually related in some way to the archives, are often held here.Next to the Plaça del Rei, the palau (palace) was built in the 1550s as the residence of the Spanish lloctinent (viceroy) of Catalonia and later converted into a convent. From 1853 it housed the Arxiu de la Corona d’Aragón, a unique archive with documents detailing the history of the Crown of Aragón and Catalonia, starting in the 12th century and reaching to the 20th.		2.17719717728	41.3840281464	None							[]	[]		activity

spain	barcelona	Casa Vicens	The angular, turreted 1888 Casa Vicens was one of Gaudí’s first commissions. Tucked away west of Gràcia’s main drag, the richly detailed facade of this private house is awash with ceramic colour and shape. The house was up for sale at the time of writing, but rumour had it that an Andorran bank had placed an offer and was planning to open it to the public.As was frequently the case, Gaudí sought inspiration from the past, in this case the rich heritage of building in the Mudéjar-style brick, typical in those parts of Spain reconquered from the Muslims. Mudéjar architecture was created by those Arabs and Berbers allowed to remain in Spain after the Christian conquests.	90	2.150842451	41.40359259	5.0	45	61	19	0	1	4.0	[]	['Architectural Buildings', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity

spain	barcelona	Roman Walls	From Plaça del Rei it's worth a detour to see the two best surviving stretches of Barcelona's Roman walls, which once boasted 78 towers (as much a matter of prestige as of defence). One section is on the southeast side of Plaça de Ramon Berenguer el Gran, with the Capella Reial de Santa Àgata atop. The other is a little further south, by the northern end of Carrer del Sots-tinent Navarro. They date from the 3rd and 4th centuries, when the Romans rebuilt their walls after the first attacks by Germanic tribes from the north.		2.177149	41.384698	None							[]	[]		activity

And unlike El Bulli, it's an affordable venture – if you can book a table, that is (you can only book online, and two months in advance).It's a fairly flamboyant and modern affair in terms of decor, playing with circus images and theatre lights, while the food has kept some of the El Bulli greats such as the 'air baguette' – a crust larded with Iberico ham, or the slightly bonkers 'cotton candy tree', with fruit-studded candyfloss clouds served on a small bush.
