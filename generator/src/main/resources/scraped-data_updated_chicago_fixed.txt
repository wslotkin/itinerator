Frank Gehry's 120ft-high swooping silver band shell anchors what is, in essence, an outdoor modern design gallery. It includes Jaume Plensa's 50ft-high Crown Fountain , which projects video images of locals spitting water, gargoyle style; the Gehry-designed BP Bridge that spans Columbus Dr and offers great skyline views; and the McCormick Tribune Ice Rink that fills with skaters in winter (and alfresco diners in summer). The newest installment is the Nichols Bridgeway that arches from the park up to the Art Institute's 3rd-floor contemporary sculpture garden (free to view).However, the thing that has become the park's biggest draw is 'the Bean' – officially titled Cloud Gate – Anish Kapoor's ridiculously smooth, 110-ton, silver-drop sculpture. Locals and visitors alike find it hard to resist such playful art, as you'll see from all the folks splashing around in Crown Fountain and touching the sculpture.In summer, Millennium's acoustically awesome band shell – Pritzker Pavilion – hosts free concerts at lunchtime and at 6:30pm. For the latter, bring a picnic and bottle of wine and tune in to new music on Mondays, jazz and world music on Thursdays, and classical music on most other days.

But it’s just one in a long line of high-flying buildings in Chicago. Ever since the city presented the world with the first skyscraper in 1885, it has thought big with its architecture and pushed the envelope of modern design. The Loop is ground zero for gawking.The following buildings represent the pioneering Chicago School style, stressing economy, simplicity and function. Daniel Burnham and Louis Sullivan were the era’s ideas men.Architecture buffs on a pilgrimage bow down first to the Monadnock Building , two buildings in one that depict a crucial juncture in skyscraper development. The north half is the older, traditional design from 1891 (with thick, load-bearing walls), while the south is the newer, mod half (with a metal frame that allows for jazzier-looking walls and bigger windows). See the difference?The 1888 Rookery looks hulking and fortresslike outside, but it’s light and airy inside thanks to Frank Lloyd Wright’s atrium overhaul. Step inside and have a look. Pigeons used to roost here, hence the name.Weep all you want over the old Marshall Field’s becoming Macy’s; the building remains a classic no matter who’s in it. The iconic bronze corner clocks on the outside have given busy Loop workers the time for over 100 years now. Inside, a 6000-sq-ft dome designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany caps the north-side atrium; 50 artists toiled for 18 months to make it. The best view is from Ladies’ Lingerie, on the 5th floor.Carson Pirie Scott & Co was originally criticized as being too ornamental to serve as a retail building. You be the judge, as you admire Louis Sullivan’s superb metalwork around the main entrance at State and Madison Sts. Though Sullivan insisted that ‘form follows function,’ it’s hard to see his theory at work in this lavishly flowing cast iron. Amid the flowing botanical and geometric forms, look for Sullivan’s initials, LHS. The century-old department store vacated the building in 2007, and it has become office space.The architects behind the Marquette Building made natural light and ventilation vital components. While that’s nice, the most impressive features are the sculptured panels and mosaics that recall the exploits of French explorer Jacques Marquette; look for them above the entrance and in the lobby (where there’s also a free little exhibit on Chicago School architecture).With its 16 stories of shimmering glass, framed by brilliant white terra-cotta details, the Reliance Building is a breath of fresh air. The structure’s lightweight internal metal frame – much of which was erected in only 15 days – supports a glass facade that gives it a feeling of lightness, a style that didn’t become universal until after WWII. Today the Reliance houses the chic Hotel Burnham. Added historical bonus: Al Capone’s dentist drilled teeth in what’s now room 809.Another terra-cotta beauty is the 1904 Santa Fe Building , where architect Daniel Burnham kept his offices. Enter the lobby and look up at the vast light well Burnham placed in the center – he gave this same feature to the Rookery. Appropriately enough, the Santa Fe Building now houses the Chicago Architecture Foundation.And last, but certainly not least, no discussion of famed Loop architecture is complete without mentioning the boxy, metal-and-glass International Style of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. His Kluczynski Building , part of the Chicago Federal Center , is a prime example; he designed many more buildings at the Illinois Institute of Technology."

Shifting populations, urban decay and the construction of a wall of public housing along State St led to Bronzeville’s decline. In the last decade it started its comeback. Many young urban professionals have moved back to the neighborhood, and South Loop development stretches almost all the way here. Still, be careful at night; it’s not a good place to be walking around after dark.Examples of stylish architecture from the past can be found throughout Bronzeville, but some of the buildings are in miserable shape and aren’t worthy of more than an inspection of the exterior. You can see some fine homes along two blocks of Calumet Ave between 31st and 33rd Sts, an area known as ‘the Gap.’ The buildings here include Frank Lloyd Wright’s only row houses, the Robert W Roloson Houses .One of scores of Romanesque houses that date from the 1880s, the Ida B Wells House is named for its 1920s resident. Wells was a crusading journalist who investigated lynchings and other racially motivated crimes. She coined the line: ‘Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.’Gospel music got its start at Pilgrim Baptist Church , originally built as a synagogue from 1890 to 1891. Unfortunately, the opulent structure burned to the ground (barring these few exterior walls) in 2006 when a roof repairman lost control of his blowtorch. Gospel fans can make a pilgrimage to two more places further south where the music still soars on Sunday. The Greater Salem Missionary Baptist Church is where gospel great Mahalia Jackson was a lifelong member. Still further south, modern Salem Baptist Church boasts one of the city’s top choral ensembles, and is helmed by the charismatic state senator Reverend James Meeks.The Supreme Life Building , a 1930s office building, was the spot where John H Johnson Jr, the publishing mogul who founded Ebony magazine, got the idea for his empire, which includes Jet and other important titles serving African Americans. There’s a little neighborhood visitors center that sells old albums and trinkets behind the bank here; enter from 35th St.In the median at 35th St and Martin Luther King Jr Dr, the Victory Monument was erected in 1928 in honor of the black soldiers who fought in WWI.

The US Steel Works in Gary, Indiana, made it to Picasso’s specifications and erected it in 1967. When Chicago tried to pay Picasso for the work, he refused the money, saying the sculpture was meant as a gift to the city. At the time, many locals thought it was hideous and should be torn down and replaced with a statue of Cubs’ great Ernie Banks.Joan Miró’s work The Sun, the Moon and One Star , known now as Miró’s Chicago , is across the street from ’the Picasso.’ Miró hoped to evoke the ‘mystical force of a great earth mother’ with this 40ft sculpture, made of various metals, cement and tile in 1981.French sculptor Jean Dubuffet created Monument with Standing Beast , which everyone just calls ‘Snoopy in a Blender,’ at around the same time. The white fiberglass work looks a little like inflated puzzle pieces and has a definite Keith Haring feel to it. As you can see by the large number of kids crawling around inside, it’s definitely a hands-on piece of art.Russian-born artist Marc Chagall loved Chicago, and in 1974 he donated a grand mosaic called the Four Seasons to the city. Using thousands of bits of glass and stone, the artist portrayed six scenes of the city in hues reminiscent of the Mediterranean coast of France, where he kept his studio. Chagall continued to make further adjustments, such as updating the skyline, after the work arrived in Chicago.A few blocks south on Dearborn, Alexander Calder’s soaring red-pink sculpture Flamingo provides some much needed relief from the stark facades of the federal buildings around it.

The mansions sitting along Astor St, especially the 1300 to 1500 blocks, reflect the grandeur of that heady period.While he was still working for Louis Sullivan, Frank Lloyd Wright (who was 19 at the time) designed the large but only 11-room Charnley-Persky House , and proclaimed with his soon-to-be-trademarked bombast that it was the ‘first modern building.’ Why? Simply because it did away with Victorian gaudiness in favor of plain, abstract forms that went on to become the modern style. It was completed in 1892 and now houses the Society of Architectural Historians.The Cyrus McCormick Mansion is one of the neighborhood’s standouts. The 1893 neoclassical home was designed by New York architect Stanford White. McCormick and his family had the whole place to themselves, but it’s now divided up into condos. It’s still the high-rent district – a three-bedroom, three-bathroom unit goes for $1.75 million (washer and dryer included).The 1885 mansion that serves as the Archbishop’s Residence spans the entire block to Astor.

The following describes some of the notable buildings in the area as you travel from north to south.A snazzy renovation of the Mergenthaler Lofts , the 1886 headquarters for the legendary linotype company, included the artful preservation of a diner storefront. The Pontiac Building , a classic 1891 design by Holabird & Roche, features the same flowing masonry surfaces as the firm's Monadnock Building to the north.A massive and once-windowless wreck, the 1911 Transportation Building enjoyed a 1980 restoration that assured the neighborhood had arrived. The Second Franklin Building , a 1912 factory, shows the history of printing on its tiled facade.

A gravel path takes off from the boathouse and circles the water, where you’ll sometimes see people fishing. Across the street, on the northwest corner of Humboldt Dr and Division St, lies the Formal Garden , rich with jelly-bean-colored flower beds and bison sculptures (by Edward Kemeys, the gent who hewed the Art Institute lions). It’s a fine place to sit and smell the roses. Just south, the Institute of Puerto Rican Arts and Culture has cool free exhibits ongoing.

Today the tower houses the City Gallery , showcasing Chicago-themed works by local photographers.Built in 1869, the tower and pumping station were constructed with local yellow limestone in a Gothic style popular at the time. It's this stone and lack of flammable interiors that saved them when the fire roared through town.The Water Tower was the great hope of Chicago when it first opened, one part of a great technological breakthrough that was going to provide fresh, clean water for the city from intake cribs set far out in Lake Michigan. Before then, the city’s drinking water had come from shore-side collection basins that sucked in sewage-laden water and industrial runoff from the Chicago River. Garnished with the occasional school of small fish, it all ended up in the sinks and bathtubs of unhappy Chicago residents.Though the fish problem was solved by the new system, the plan was ultimately a failure. Sewage from the river, propelled by spring rains, made its way out to the new intake bins. The whole smelly situation didn’t abate until the Chicago River was reversed in the 1890s (when engineers used canals and locks to send sewage away from Lake Michigan). By 1906 the Water Tower was obsolete and only public outcry saved it from demolition three times. Whether Oscar Wilde would have joined the preservationists is debatable: when he visited Chicago in 1881 he called the Water Tower ‘a castellated monstrosity with salt and pepper boxes stuck all over it’.
