His isn’t your typical taco menu: Bayless uses seasonal, sustainable ingredients for his wood-grilled meats, flavor-packed mole sauces, chili-thickened braises and signature margaritas. Though they share space, Topolobampo and Frontera Grill are actually two separate restaurants: Topolo is sleeker and pricier, while Frontera is more informal.  Both places are always packed. Frontera takes some reservations but mostly seats on a first-come basis. Reserve in advance for Topolobampo (six to eight weeks beforehand is recommended). Note the restaurants close between 2:30pm and 5:30pm (in which case you might want to try Bayless' lower-priced Xoco eatery next door). Frontera also serves brunch on Saturday, starting at 10:30am. Who knows – you might see President Obama forking in next to you. Topolobampo is his favorite restaurant. He and Michelle prefer table 65.
